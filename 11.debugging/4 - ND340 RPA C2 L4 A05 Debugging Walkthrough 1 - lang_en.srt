1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,075
In this example, we will see how to use the debugging tool from the UiPath Studio.

2
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:09,330
For that we have built a workflow which opens up

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,535
a Google form website and it reads all the values from an Excel sheet,

4
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:16,530
that is the challenge.xlsx,

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,850
and it inputs all the values into the Google form.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,350
Now, let us try to debug the application.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,450
For that under the ribbon bar,

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,295
navigate to the debug section and click on the "Debug Play Icon".

9
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:35,475
Now, you can see the debug process has

10
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:39,730
started and this is the web form that we are entering it.

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,315
Now, as you can see,

12
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:47,195
the debug process has stopped and as you can clearly see here in the output panel,

13
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:49,435
that we got an exception.

14
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:51,295
Now, the exception or the error,

15
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:55,045
it says that the input string is not in the correct format.

16
00:00:55,045 --> 00:01:00,905
As you can easily notice here that this particular activity has been highlighted.

17
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:04,175
That means this activity is causing a trouble.

18
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:10,400
Now over here, the reason is very simple because we had a phone number text field,

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,970
and the conversion to the number did not happen correctly,

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,090
and so is the error that has been thrown to us.

21
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,360
Now, let us look at some of the options available in the debugging and being bad.

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,300
Over here, we have options;

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,955
Retry, Ignore, and Restart.

24
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:28,830
Now, as the name suggest,

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,350
Retry it will try executing this particular activity again.

26
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,100
Let us try executing this particular activity.

27
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:43,610
As you can see, it started and it said again that the activity was not able to perform.

28
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,100
Let us try again and as you can see here,

29
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,795
we've got the faulted message or the error here again.

30
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:53,295
Now we also have the Ignore and the Restart.

31
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:56,210
Now Ignore basically means it will skip

32
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,735
that particular activity and it will move forward.

33
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:02,975
As you can see here, this particular activity has been

34
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:07,950
ignored and we can say hit "Continue" to proceed further.

35
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,635
So as you can see here,

36
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:14,315
that the IT and the India was perfectly

37
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:18,365
executed and we skipped this particular phone number field.

38
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:21,040
We also have an option called as Restart.

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,825
Now, Restart basically will restart the whole debugging process again.

40
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:29,165
Now, before moving ahead,

41
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:31,730
as we saw that we had an header in

42
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,255
this activity that is the type into for the phone number.

43
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:40,990
Now, let us head back to the Excel workbook and see what exactly is causing this error.

44
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,310
As you can see clearly over here,

45
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,860
that the phone number is not in the correct format.

46
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,325
We have some alphabets also present in the phone number.

47
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:53,315
Let us edit the data and make it as a proper data.

48
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:57,350
Awesome. Now let us close the Excel workbook and let us

49
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,490
try executing or try restarting the debugging process again.

50
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,685
Now, before we start the debugging process again,

51
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,820
let us put a break point after the phone number field.

52
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,245
So we have a sequence here,

53
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:10,520
which is the phone number,

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,340
and we have a sequence that is for the department.

55
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,555
Now, adding a breakpoint over here means that

56
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:22,250
the execution will stop after the phone number field.

57
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,110
Let us restart the debugging process.

58
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,200
Now you can see easily the debugging process has been

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,500
started again and you can see John, Address,

60
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,995
and now you can see the phone number has been

61
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:41,390
correctly entered since we meet the edit in the Excel workbook.

62
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,550
Now the application is in the paused state because we have added a breakpoint here,

63
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,925
that means the workflow will not continue from this point.

64
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:54,455
Now, let us look at the other options that we have available here.

65
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:55,745
We have Step Into,

66
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:58,040
Step Over, and Step Out.

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,765
Now, as the name suggests,

68
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:06,125
step into the Step Into will debug all the activities one at a time.

69
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,460
Let us try using this Step Into option.

70
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,850
If I click Step Into for the first time,

71
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,990
as you can see, the Assign activity has been highlighted.

72
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,440
Now the Assign activity will be executed and you can see the logs for

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,915
that and it has taken the next activity that is the log message.

74
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,105
Let us click on this "Step Into" again.

75
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:29,150
Now you can see the log messages have been executed

76
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,465
and now the control is in the type into activity.

77
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:35,630
Let's click on the "Step Into" again and now you can

78
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,439
see the type into activity has been performed successfully.

79
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,755
Now let us see the option for the Step Over.

80
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:48,065
Now the Step Over is used when you want to run the entire container,

81
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:50,555
that is the sequence or the workflow together.

82
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:54,695
In this case, it will not execute each activity one at a time,

83
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,515
but it will execute the entire sequence,

84
00:04:57,515 --> 00:04:59,885
that is the container in a single go.

85
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,060
Let us click on this "Step Over".

86
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,165
Now after that, we have that location.

87
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:08,885
Now let us execute this step over for the location.

88
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:10,940
The moment I click on "Step Over",

89
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,775
the entire sequence will be executed.

90
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:18,019
Now you can see it did not go into any of the particular activities,

91
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,975
but it executed the entire sequence,

92
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:23,690
that is Enter Location at one go.

93
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,690
Now, let us also look at the options,

94
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,295
that is the Step Out.

95
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,650
Now, as the name suggests, step out,

96
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,560
this action is used for stepping out and pausing

97
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,830
the execution or the level of the current container.

98
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,970
That means it will execute each and everything in

99
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,340
the parent container and it will pause

100
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,820
the debugging when it reaches the parent container again.

101
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,050
So in our case,

102
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,710
the parent container for us is this body activity,

103
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,710
which is inside the for each row activity.

104
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,550
Let us do a step out.

105
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,890
Now I can see the submit and submit another response was executed and it stopped

106
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,615
the execution when it reached

107
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:10,410
the parent container that is the body container in our case.

108
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,505
Now, let us look how to use the local panel in the debugging window.

109
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:18,400
Now here again, we have made changes into

110
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,600
the Excel file and we'll throw an exception when the debugging is running.

111
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,090
Let us start executing the debugging process.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,965
Now you can see the debugging process has started and now at the phone number section,

113
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,215
we got the error again.

114
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:39,370
Now let us use the local panel and change

115
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,065
the values of the phone number and try continuing the debugging process.

116
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:45,580
Now in the local panel,

117
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,080
here you can see we have

118
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,030
all the variables available that we are using in the current sequence.

119
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,945
Now our variable, in that case is this phone number and you can easily see here,

120
00:06:56,945 --> 00:07:00,095
the phone number has some alphabets present.

121
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,495
Let us click on this pencil icon and edit this data.

122
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:06,765
Awesome. Let us click on "Okay".

123
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:13,640
Now we can try the Retry option and let us see if it is executing perfectly fine or not.

124
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,580
Awesome. Now you can see that the phone number executed perfectly fine.

125
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,125
To continue with the rest debugging process,

126
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,465
we can click on this Continue icon and

127
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:28,470
the debugging process will execute in the correct manner.
