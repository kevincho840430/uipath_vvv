1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,385
To start out for the exercise solution,

2
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:08,355
we have created three variables here: name and age and we have a DataTable variable,

3
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:10,590
the name is PersonInfoDT.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,440
Now, depending upon the user input,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,010
that is the user enters a correct age format,

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,915
we will build a DataTable.

7
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:21,720
In DataTable, we have the name and the age field,

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,125
and we will write the user input into the DataTable.

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:29,310
Later, we will also write the data into CSV file.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,815
If the data enters a wrong format for the age,

11
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:35,265
then we will throw a exception.

12
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:36,470
In the catch block here,

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,320
we have chosen a message box and we'll print

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,355
the message to the user saying that you entered an invalid data.

15
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:46,170
Let us run this workflow.

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,480
Let us enter a name and let us give the age.

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,405
For this first run, we will give the age in a correct format.

18
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:57,875
Awesome, the workflow has completed.

19
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,710
Now over here, let us do a quick refresh

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,750
and let us open the.CSV file that has been created.

21
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,930
Here you can see that the data that you entered

22
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,125
has been successfully entered into the CSV file.

23
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:17,370
Let us close this and let us run the workflow again.

24
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,870
Now, let us provide the name and in this case,

25
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,905
let us provide data which is not in the number format.

26
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:27,185
Let us give some random text.

27
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:29,320
Now let us click on "OK".

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,110
Here we got the exception saying that," Your data that you entered is invalid."
