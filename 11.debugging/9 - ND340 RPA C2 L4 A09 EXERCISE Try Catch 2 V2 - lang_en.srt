1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
Let us look at the solution for this exercise.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,730
The bot will read this Excel file and it will

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,180
calculate the difference between the selling price and the cost price.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,545
As you can see here,

5
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:14,450
the data is not correct for all the fields that we have.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,680
We have some alphabet for some of the cost price and the selling price.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,574
Now the bot needs to do the subtraction,

8
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:23,885
that is the selling price minus the cost price.

9
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:28,705
If the data in the cost price and in the selling price are in the correct number format,

10
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:31,910
the bot will do the difference and put the values

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,330
here and it will set the status to success.

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,175
If the data is incorrect,

13
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:38,645
say for example in this case,

14
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:41,030
we have 13K and we have 130.

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,010
This is an incorrect data.

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,610
In that case, the bot will not perform the difference but

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,465
it will set the status to incorrect data in the cell.

18
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:53,490
Let us see a solution for it.

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,015
Here in the UiPath Studio,

20
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,205
under the sequence we have started with

21
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:01,945
a "Read Range" activity which reads the Excel file,

22
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:04,870
and we're storing it in a variable called as "CashDT."

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,450
Now we have used a "ForEachRow" activity to

24
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,065
look through all the records in the Excel file,

25
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:11,710
that is the data table.

26
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,455
Here we have used a "TryCatch" block.

27
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:19,420
In the try block, we are using these two assign activity where we are

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,325
fetching the values of the cost price and we're fetching the values of the selling price,

29
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:28,475
and we're converting them into a string using the CINT method.

30
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:31,600
Next, we are performing the difference,

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,550
that is the selling price minus

32
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,050
the cost price and we're writing it into the corresponding cell.

33
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,870
To write into the corresponding cell,

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,065
we are using a variable called as "cellNumber."

35
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:43,580
Now in the variables panel,

36
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,520
the "cellNumber" default value is 2 because the

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,310
first is the header and we have to start from the second row,

38
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,180
and each and every time we are incrementing

39
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,755
the cell number by one so that we can increase the row value.

40
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:00,620
Next we're using another "Write Cell" activity.

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,200
This is to write a message "Success" and in the catch block over here,

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,720
we are specifying that if the number conversion format is not proper,

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,155
then over here first we use a "Log Message" to throw

44
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:18,060
the exception that is the number conversion could not

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,219
happen and we're using a "Write Cell" activity.

46
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:24,290
In the "Write Cell" activity in the status column will

47
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,705
set the status as incorrect data in the cell.

48
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:30,665
Let us see the workflow in action.

49
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:35,515
Let us save the workflow and let us run the workflow.

50
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:39,845
Awesome. The bot was able to complete the process.

51
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:43,925
Now let us do a quick refresh and open the Excel file.

52
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,730
Here you can see all the differences has been

53
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,895
added and for the values which was incorrect,

54
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:52,010
the difference could not be calculated and

55
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,100
the status is set to incorrect data in the cell.
