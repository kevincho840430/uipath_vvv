1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,125
Now that we have seen how to automate various task,

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:09,480
let us dive deep into debugging and exception handling in the UiPath.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,455
In this lesson, we will learn about debugging in the UiPath.

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:18,720
We look at the debugging interface and the debugging panels in UiPath.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,020
Next, we will learn about what are exceptions in

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,655
UiPath and how can we handle exceptions in UiPath studio.

7
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:29,885
Lastly, we will see how can we test

8
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:34,220
an individual workflows by passing a default value to it?

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,080
At the end of the lesson,

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,920
you should be able to understand and use debugging techniques to find errors.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,155
Define exception handling, and use of different types of exceptions in finding error.

12
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:55,110
Run and test your automations with default values, and reusable code.
