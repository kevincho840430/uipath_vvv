1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
With debugging and exception handling techniques that you have learned,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,230
I hope this will help you to build

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,895
an automation that can handle exception while it is in production.

4
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:16,080
In this lesson, we learned about debugging in UiPath,

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,430
and saw the debugging interface and the panel in UiPath.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,735
Next, we learned about exception handling and

7
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:27,590
the type of exceptions in UiPath and how to handle them.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,260
We also looked at common exceptions in UiPath and the strategies to solve it.

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,465
Lastly, we looked at testing the workflows with a default value.

10
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,085
In the next lesson,

11
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:46,770
we will learn about the very important concept of UiPath, that is Orchestrator.
