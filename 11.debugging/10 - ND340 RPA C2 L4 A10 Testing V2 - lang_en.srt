1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,245
In this section, we will see how to perform testings on the activities that we have used.

2
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:11,790
For this example, we have chosen a form and we are

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,445
using the Type into Activities to input all the values inside this form.

4
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:20,595
Let us begin with the first option that is,

5
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:22,590
Run to this Activity.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,730
The Run to this Activity is available when

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,225
right-clicking an activity in the Designer Panel.

8
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:35,065
In our case, we'll choose the company name and we'll right-click on the context menu,

9
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:39,135
and from here you can see the Run into this Activity.

10
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:41,580
Now, this option starts

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,135
the Debugging processes and pauses before the selected activity is executed,

12
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:50,030
while highlighting into the Designer Panel.

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,030
Let us run this and see it in action.

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,595
Click on, Run to this Activity.

15
00:00:55,595 --> 00:01:00,815
Now you can see, the Bot is entering the values and as you saw,

16
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:03,665
the Bot has stopped the execution.

17
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:07,415
As you can see, we chose the Activity,

18
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:08,870
that is the Company,

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,210
and we chose, Run to this Activity.

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,265
So all the Activities,

21
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:15,440
that were before the Company Name,

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,610
was executed and the Debugging has been paused.

23
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,795
As you can see over here,

24
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:22,610
the First Name and the Last Name,

25
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,030
has been entered, and on the Company Name,

26
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,715
the execution has paused.

27
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:31,830
You can choose the option, Continue,

28
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,590
and proceed further or you can Stop your automation from here.

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,560
Let us see the other options that we have on the Designer Panel, Context Menu.

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
The second option that we have is,

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,850
Run from this Activity.

32
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,280
For this, we'll choose the activity role in the company.

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,650
Right-click on this, and here you have the option,

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,665
Run from this Activity.

35
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:58,430
The Run from this Activity,

36
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,105
context menu enters the debugging in a pause state,

37
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:05,390
which allows you to make changes to the values or

38
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,915
variables and arguments from the local panel.

39
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:12,325
Let us click on Run from this Activity.

40
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:13,845
Now, as you can see,

41
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:16,385
the Debugging is in a paused state.

42
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:20,540
Now the execution will start from the Role in the Company.

43
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,870
That means, all the activities which are above this,

44
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,824
Type into Activities, will be skipped and your execution,

45
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:28,130
will start from here.

46
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,070
You can even Edit the values from here.

47
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,945
For example, in our case,

48
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:36,335
let us change, the email address to something else.

49
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:39,080
Over here, the email address is, test10.

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,560
Let us change it to, test12.

51
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,130
Let us click on, Continue.

52
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,045
Here you can see, the Bot is entering the values into this field,

53
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:54,575
and you can see from here,

54
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,645
that the first three Activities,

55
00:02:56,645 --> 00:03:00,140
did not execute and only the Role in the Company,

56
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,229
Address, E-mail, and the Phone Number, got executed.

57
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:07,595
As you can also see, the updated value is being displayed here.

58
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:11,885
You can also test an individual Activity.

59
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,820
For this purpose, we'll use the,

60
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,130
Type into Activity for the Phone Number.

61
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,525
Let us drag it out of the parent container.

62
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:23,060
When you do a right-click on this Activity in the Context Menu,

63
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,180
you see an option,

64
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,050
the Text Activity, click on the Test Activity.

65
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,180
The Text Activity, Context Menu option of the Designer Panel is

66
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,095
used for running a test on a current selected activities.

67
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:40,930
In our case, we are performing the activity on the Type into the Phone Number.

68
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,890
When you click, the local panel opens up,

69
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,605
which displays the variables and the arguments.

70
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:50,360
As you can see, we have the list of all the variables available,

71
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,965
but from here, we are only interested in the Phone Number.

72
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:57,890
We can do an Edit from this local panel,

73
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,705
and we can choose some random phone number that we want to enter.

74
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:04,460
Let us click on,

75
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,970
Continue, and now you can see,

76
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,980
only that particular activity was executed

77
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,540
and we have also changed the values from the local panel.

78
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,690
Let us look at the other option that is Creating a Test Bench.

79
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,445
The Test Bench option,

80
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:27,125
allows for creation of automation building blocks,

81
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,605
which can be tested and added to the final workflow.

82
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:33,814
In that case, we'll use the Type into Activity,

83
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:36,155
will do a right-click, and from here,

84
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:38,855
you can choose, Create Test Bench.

85
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:42,920
The Create Test Bench is similar to the Text Activity option,

86
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,810
with the exception that the later is contained and defined in an actual workflow.

87
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,125
It is used for testing activities,

88
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,169
working with variables or debugging the processes.

89
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,500
All this is done in a test bench or workflow,

90
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,990
that is a temporary sequence that is not

91
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,720
a part of the current project and it is discarded,

92
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,980
when we close it.

93
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,390
As you can see here,

94
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,225
our temporary sequence has been created

95
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:11,125
and this sequence is not available in our project panel.

96
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,425
When you close this temporary sequence,

97
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:20,020
it will not be Saved and the same will not be reflected in the project panel.

98
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,355
Let us go ahead and indicate a Notepad application,

99
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:25,765
where we need to type.

100
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:27,850
In our case, we'll type the message,

101
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:34,740
" Hello and welcome to test bench."

102
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,670
Let us Save, the workflow and let us click on, Debug.

103
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,890
As you can see, the Debugging is in the pause state.

104
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,320
As you can see, we have a two break points here.

105
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,965
The first break-point is where we have created

106
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:55,880
a Test Bench for the activities and we have another break-point,

107
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,384
that is ending this sequence.

108
00:05:58,384 --> 00:06:01,300
Let us click on, Continue.

109
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,960
As you saw, the particular activity,

110
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,165
was able to perform the desired task.

111
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:12,050
That is, the Type into Activity was able to type into the Notepad and

112
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,475
now the process has again went into a pause state.

113
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:18,155
As you can see from here,

114
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:20,240
this is the only thing that is left.

115
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,445
Let us click on Continue and complete this Debugging process.

116
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:28,125
Awesome, that the Debugging process has been completed.

117
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,200
In this way, you can Create the Test Bench.

118
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,430
To summarize, the test activities,

119
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,935
we looked into Run to this Activity option.

120
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:41,820
We also looked at Run from this Activity, we also looked at,

121
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,970
how to individually test our activity in the workflow,

122
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,205
using the Test Activity option.

123
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:51,404
Lastly, we looked at how to Create a Test Bench for the activities,

124
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:54,460
that we're going to use, in the workflow.
