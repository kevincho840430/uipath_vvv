1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,450
Data manipulation is the process of changing data to

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,739
make it easier to read or to be more organized.

3
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:15,100
Manipulating data can enable it to be displayed in a common format of systems,

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,535
output verifications and beyond.

5
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:24,075
Common operations for data manipulations are, retrieving data,

6
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:27,430
it specifies a condition to extract,

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,680
filter or summarize data.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,755
Adding data, it adds new data in a data structure.

9
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:42,965
The user can specify conditions to limit the additions only to the filtered entries.

10
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:48,310
Deleting data, it removes entries from a data structure.

11
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,120
Modifying data, any type of operations

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,590
that affects the existing entries in a data structure.

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:04,120
Data is defined as a collection of information that can be stored and processed.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,550
Nowadays, data is the topmost priority for organization.

15
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:15,970
Whoever has data has the most power to use technology at their best.

16
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,720
Organizations are in deep competition to

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,755
utilize and maximize their efficiency by having data.

18
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:28,245
Having raw data is not enough,

19
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:33,625
it needs to be processed accordingly before it can be used.

20
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:39,730
However, having data is not enough as it should mean something to the company.

21
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:46,420
Meaningless data could prove to be unreliable and impossible to analyze.

22
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,735
Data manipulation covers all the operations done on data.

23
00:01:52,735 --> 00:02:00,010
Operation done on data can be differentiated based on how they achieve an outcome.

24
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:05,189
There are two types of operation, queries,

25
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:13,670
they may only be considered as read Only operations because whenever a query is executed,

26
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:19,430
it only works at a static source and returns the value accordingly.

27
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:27,005
Manipulations, these operations produce alteration over the data structures.

28
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:30,170
These operations may be inserting,

29
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,680
deleting, or modifying data.

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,890
Data manipulation is used for data filtering, verification and concatenation.

31
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,070
Most of the data manipulation language share four basic commands,

32
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,590
select, update, insert, and delete.

33
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,355
This command do not cover all the data processing techniques,

34
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:59,060
but by using conditions and configurations,

35
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,165
complex manipulations can be performed.

36
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:06,500
Let's see a basic outline of these commands.

37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,235
The Select command, this is used to extract,

38
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:13,030
filter, and summarize data.

39
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,450
The second command is Update,

40
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,365
this is used to add a new columns.

41
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:24,385
For example, fields, remove or update the existing one.

42
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:26,955
The third is Insert,

43
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:29,795
this is used to add new data,

44
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:32,560
for example, adding new rules.

45
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,010
The last is the Delete,

46
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,230
this is used to delete the entries by using a condition.
