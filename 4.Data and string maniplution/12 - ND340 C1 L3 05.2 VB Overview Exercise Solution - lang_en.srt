00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,395
Now that we have learned some of the common methods of VB,

2
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:06,975
let us use them in this exercise.

3
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:14,460
In this exercise, we will move some files from a particular folder to another folder.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,440
Here you can see in the next step,

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,735
I have two folders named from and to.

6
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:23,100
The from folders has four files into it.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,915
It has a document file,

8
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:27,840
a PDF file, a text file, and an Excel file.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,000
We will move all these files to the folder "to".

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,045
Let us see the solution for it.

11
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:42,035
Inside the sequence, the first activity that we are using is the Select Folder activity.

12
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:44,585
In this Select Folder activity,

13
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:47,950
we will be selecting the source folder.

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,815
After that, we have used an assign activity.

15
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,735
In this assign activity,

16
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:59,270
we are using directory.dotgetfiles method.

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,235
From this method, we will take all the files or basically,

18
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:11,080
we will fetch all the files from the source folder and store it in a variable file name.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,095
After that, we are again using a select folder.

20
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:18,440
This activity is responsible to select

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,070
the destination of the folder where the files will be moved.

22
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,585
We're using a variable destination folder for it.

23
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,220
Inside the 'for each' activity,

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,095
we are iterating or each one of the file name one at a time.

25
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:34,760
Inside the file loop,

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,780
we are using an activity move file.

27
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,625
The move file activity has two parameters,

28
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,140
the from and the to.

29
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,395
In the from we're parsing the file name,

30
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,405
and in the to destination,

31
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:49,760
we are parsing the destination folder.

32
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,405
Let us see the example.

33
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:56,805
Right now, all the files are in the 'from' folder.

34
00:01:56,805 --> 00:02:02,465
Here you can see it is asking me to select the source folder.

35
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:04,435
I'll select "from".

36
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:10,275
Again, it is prompting to select the destination folder, I'll select "to".

37
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:13,315
The bot has successfully executed.

38
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:15,330
As you can see here,

39
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:22,980
the "from" folder is empty and all the files have been moved to the 'to' folder.
