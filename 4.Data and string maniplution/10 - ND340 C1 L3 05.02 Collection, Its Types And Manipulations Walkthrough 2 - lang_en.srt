1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Now that we have learned about dictionaries,

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,705
let us look at an example to see how to use dictionaries in the UiPath studio.

3
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:13,105
Moving ahead, first, we'll create a variable of the type dictionary.

4
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:14,755
Under the variable panel,

5
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:19,520
we'll create a variable with the name employee details.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,870
We'll choose the variable type as dictionaries.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,910
Since dictionary is not available here,

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:30,575
we'll click on "Browse for Type" and from here we will filter out dictionaries.

9
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:34,500
Select the dictionaries from the class collection.generic.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,370
For the key value we will select the key as

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,600
string and for the value we'll select "List of String".

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,660
We will search for list and we'll choose

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,870
the list from the collection.generic class and

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,640
over here we'll select the list value as string.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,120
Awesome. Now, the dictionary key is string

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,250
and the value as list of string. Click on "Okay".

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:13,605
Now, we have declared a dictionary of the type key as string and value as list of string.

18
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:17,265
Now let us go ahead and instantiate the dictionaries.

19
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:20,775
Over here we'll see new dictionary,

20
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:26,955
and since we have key and value so we'll see off string because key is off string,

21
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:29,585
and since the value as a list,

22
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:34,285
we'll see list of string.

23
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:39,680
Awesome. Now, we have declared the string and we have instantiated the string.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,005
Now, let us go ahead and initialize the dictionaries with some values.

25
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,235
For that, we'll use the assign activity.

26
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:52,410
Drag and drop the Assign activity into the data in the panel.

27
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,850
Now, let us go ahead and create our dictionary key.

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,725
In that case, we'll create a key with the name HR.

29
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:06,715
Now, let us go ahead and initialize it with some values.

30
00:02:06,715 --> 00:02:13,590
Here, we'll say new list of string,

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,475
and let us insert some values.

32
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:21,605
The first value that will insert is David,

33
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:23,795
and we will insert other value.

34
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:27,350
The second value here would be Daniel.

35
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,860
Awesome. Let us click on "Okay".

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,950
Now, we have created a dictionary where the key is

37
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,320
HR and the value with the key is David and Daniel.

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,890
Let us go ahead and create another dictionary.

39
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:50,090
In this case, we'll name the key as IT and in this IT department,

40
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,580
we will add values.

41
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,110
In our case, we'll name the first employee in

42
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,700
the IT section as Niyaz and the another employee as Heba.

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,150
Now, we have created two dictionaries.

44
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,465
The first dictionary key HR and it holds the value David and Daniel.

45
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:19,720
We have an another dictionary where the key is IT and the value here is Niyaz and Heba.

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,660
Now, let us go ahead and print one of the dictionaries.

47
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,635
We will use our write line activity.

48
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:34,515
Now in this write line activity we'll call the joint method so we'll say string.join.

49
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:40,470
Here, we'll use comma to join both the values and here we will have to pass the key.

50
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,890
The key in our case that we want to print is IT.

51
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,245
Awesome. Let us go ahead and click on "Okay".

52
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:50,830
Let us run the workflow.

53
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,145
In that case we are trying to print values of the key IT.

54
00:03:56,145 --> 00:04:00,775
As you can see, the value we have printed is Niyaz and Heba.

55
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:08,420
Now, let us go ahead and add more values into to the dictionaries that we have created.

56
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,089
We can use the collection activity,

57
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:14,065
drag and drop the Add to collection.

58
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:18,304
Now, in this Add to collection in the collection properties,

59
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:22,250
we need to mention in which dictionary do we want to add values.

60
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:29,930
In that case, we will mention

61
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,920
that we need to add it into the employee details of IT.

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,505
Let us change the type argument to string.

63
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:39,485
Now here is where you need to add the values.

64
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:43,960
In that case, we will add the value as Christa.

65
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,850
Now, let us go ahead and print the dictionary.

66
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:00,095
We have used two write line activities and we are printing the employees of IT.

67
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:03,270
In this write line we are assuming there should be two values,

68
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,490
Niyaz and Heba, and we added one more value, that is Christa.

69
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,555
Here, we are assuming that three values should be printed.

70
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:13,485
Let us run the workflow and see the output.

71
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:19,390
Awesome. Here, you can see Christa has been added and it has been accordingly printed.

72
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,965
In the same way, you can also check if any of the element exists in the collection,

73
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,810
drag and drop the existing collection.

74
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,850
Here in the collection section,

75
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,630
we will mention the employee of HR,

76
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,975
change the argument type to string.

77
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:43,310
Here, we will see if David exist in this dictionary or not.

78
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,385
Since the result will give us add Boolean value,

79
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:48,770
let us go ahead and create a variable.

80
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,105
We'll name the variable as employee exist.

81
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:57,260
If the employee David exist it will return a true value,

82
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,375
or if it does not exist it will return a false value.

83
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:05,565
Let us go ahead and print the Boolean variable.

84
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,720
We'll use a write line activity again and over here,

85
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,050
we'll print the variable employee exist and we'll convert it to string.

86
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,530
Let us run the workflow.

87
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,665
In there under the output panel,

88
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:23,210
here you can see the value has been printed as true that

89
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,620
means David was available in the dictionary that we were searching for.

90
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,030
The same way you can also use the Remove from collection.

91
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,430
Drag and drop the remove from collection and over here we

92
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,130
need to mention the collection or the dictionary.

93
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:44,045
In our example, we will tell we need to remove a value from the HR dictionary,

94
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:46,595
convert the type to string,

95
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:50,080
and from here we will remove David.

96
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,905
Awesome. Now, let us use the write line

97
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:59,315
again and print the value after the removal of the values.

98
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:04,255
Let us change the department to HR.

99
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:06,510
Let us save it,

100
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,300
and let us run the workflow.

101
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,375
Awesome. Here you can see we've got

102
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:16,050
the Niyaz and Heba and then we added Christa so Christa was printed.

103
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,350
Then we were searching if David is available.

104
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,940
Yes, David was available and David existed in the dictionary as we got true.

105
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,880
Since we removed David from the dictionary and then we are printing the dictionary,

106
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,450
here you can see there is only Daniel available right now.

107
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,600
In this example, we saw how to create,

108
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,745
declare and instantiate a dictionary,

109
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:40,205
and how to add a value into the dictionaries,

110
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:45,390
and we saw how to use the collection activities with the dictionaries.
