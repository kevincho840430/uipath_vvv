1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Now, we have learned about the common UI activities properties.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,040
Let us try to implement it in this exercise.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,710
Here, we will work on the notepad application.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,360
First thing first, we need to open the notepad application.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,940
After opening the notepad application,

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,555
we need to type our text into the text box.

7
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:27,855
This is the text that we need to write into the text box

8
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:31,785
that is," Automation makes life easier."

9
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:36,090
After that, you need to minimize the notepad,

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,495
making sure that when the board minimizes the notepad,

11
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:42,600
the simulate click property is checked.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,625
Next, we need to type a different set of text.

13
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,125
We will be typing,

14
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,615
"Welcome to the new world of automation".

15
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:54,330
When the boat is typing this text,

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,780
we'll have to make sure that the send window message property is checked.

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,455
Later, we need to change the font type,

18
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:08,060
default style, and increase the font size by five.

19
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,575
To do that, we'll select the entire text,

20
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:15,145
click on "Format", click on "Font",

21
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:19,910
change the font type to Times New Roman,

22
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,950
and change the font style to Italic.

23
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,640
Now, you can see the font size is 28.

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,760
We need to increase the font size by five.

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,800
Now the current font size should be 33.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,805
We need to hit the "Enter Key". That's it.

27
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:47,030
Let us build the application for this use case.

28
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,405
Before going ahead, let me change the format.

29
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:54,000
Let me just increase the font size a little bit.

30
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,310
Here is the solution for the application that we just saw.

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,520
As you can see, we have started with the "Sequence",

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,060
and we are using the "Open Application".

33
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,860
In the "Open Application",

34
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,270
we have make sure that we are opening up the notepad application.

35
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,955
Inside the open application,

36
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:18,980
the first thing that we're doing is,

37
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,455
we're using the type into activity.

38
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:23,270
In this type into activity,

39
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,555
we will write," Automation makes life easier."

40
00:02:26,555 --> 00:02:30,170
After that, we'll click on "Minimize".

41
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,290
As you can see in the properties panel,

42
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,750
the "SimulateClick" has been checked to "True".

43
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,050
After that, we will type the different set of information that is we'll type,

44
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,500
"Welcome to the new world of automation."

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,150
On the properties panel,

46
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,805
you can see the "SendWindowMessages" option,

47
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:50,870
is checked as "True".

48
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,500
After that, we are using "Send Hotkey" activity,

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,995
wherein we are choosing "Control plus K", as the shortcut.

50
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:06,310
We are doing so, so that we can select all the text and then we can edit the font,

51
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,415
the font size, and default style.

52
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:11,680
After we have selected all the text,

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,275
we will click on the "Format" button.

54
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:15,985
After the format button,

55
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:18,085
we'll click on the "Font".

56
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:23,295
Now, once you are in the font window,

57
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:26,220
we will use the "Type into" activity.

58
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,875
This first "Type into" activity,

59
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,715
we are using it for changing the font type.

60
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:34,950
The next "Type Into" activity,

61
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,815
we are using to change the font style.

62
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:41,285
We will change the font style to Italic.

63
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:44,720
The next activity is the "Get Text" activity.

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,845
Here, we are first checking what is the default font size available.

65
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:56,135
The Get Text will take the value of the font size,

66
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,045
and will store it in a variable font size.

67
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:02,765
Now later, we will use a Type Into activity,

68
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:08,285
and the value that we fetched we'll increase it by five.

69
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:11,985
On the last, we will send an Hotkey,

70
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,995
that is the "Enter Key",

71
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:17,850
to close the format window.

72
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,710
Let us run the boat.

73
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,050
Minimize. As you can see,

74
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,575
"Welcome to the new world" has been already written.

75
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:34,340
Changing the font style and the font size.

76
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,245
Here you can see,

77
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:40,350
all the actions were performed successfully.
