1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,775
In this exercise, we will use string manipulation methods and apply it on a string.

2
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:11,535
We have the string available with us.

3
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:16,725
The string is, you always wanted to study automation training.

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:25,200
The materials are available in the following places: Udacity, UiPath Docs.

5
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,685
From the first sentence,

6
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:32,900
we need to extract study Automation Training.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,015
From the second sentence,

8
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:40,715
we need to extract Udacity and UiPath Docs separately.

9
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:46,655
Lastly, we need to combine them and print this message that is,

10
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:54,505
study Automation Training from: Udacity; UiPath Docs.

11
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:57,855
Let us see the solution for it.

12
00:00:57,855 --> 00:01:00,045
Inside the sequence activity,

13
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:02,659
we have used an assign activity.

14
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,399
In this assign activity,

15
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:09,265
we have assigned the predefined text where manipulation will happen.

16
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:13,490
We are storing it in a variable called as, "message."

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,165
In the next assign activity,

18
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:19,420
we will start splitting the text.

19
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:27,185
Via first splitting the text with respect to a delimiter that is, period.

20
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:30,565
That means, from this entire string,

21
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:34,880
we will split the string with on basis of this period.

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,905
Now, we will use a substring method and in that substring method,

23
00:01:41,905 --> 00:01:45,365
we will substring it with the keyword, "study."

24
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:48,760
That means from the first split that happen,

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,455
we got this information.

26
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:54,350
From this information, we will use

27
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,670
a substring method and we will split it on the keyboard study.

28
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,190
That is, we have this piece of information available.

29
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,915
Now, this will be stored into a variable called as, "study."

30
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:12,490
Next, we are again using an assign activity.

31
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,315
In this assign activity,

32
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:16,510
we will further split the string,

33
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,080
we'll use the message variable and in

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,590
that message variable will again split it with respect to the delimiter,

35
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,420
that is, "period. "

36
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,335
So we will split again with respect to this period over here.

37
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:33,110
Now, we're interested in this text.

38
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,060
Now from this text,

39
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,855
you can see easily we have given the area number one,

40
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:41,615
because when you split the string,

41
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:44,750
the result is stored it in a form of an added.

42
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,505
So, in the zero position,

43
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:48,214
we have this information,

44
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:51,200
and in the first position we have this information,

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,490
as we are interested in this piece of information,

46
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,000
so we have explicitly mentioned the area position

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,720
here will convert it into a string and again,

48
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,885
we will split it with respect to, "colon."

49
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:06,875
That is, we are going to split it with respect to this delimiter.

50
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,645
Now, we are interested in this piece.

51
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:14,690
That is the reason we have used, Last.ToString.

52
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,120
Again, we are splitting it with respect to,

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,435
"comma" because we need Udacity and UiPath Docs separately,

54
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,105
so now, this is the delimiter that we're going to use.

55
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:32,125
Now, we will store this information into a variable, "study."

56
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:36,575
Sorry, we will store it into a variable, "places."

57
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:42,475
Lastly, we are using the message box activity to print our final message.

58
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:48,020
In the message box activity we are using the format method.

59
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,900
In the format method we have passed two arguments.

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,260
The first argument, is replaced by "study" variable,

61
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,695
and the second argument,

62
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,060
is replaced by places medium.

63
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,090
But before using the "places" variable,

64
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,290
we are joining it with respect to, "semicolon."

65
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,505
Let us run the board.

66
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:09,935
Here you can see the output patterns,

67
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:17,530
study Automation Training from: Udacity; UiPath Docs.
