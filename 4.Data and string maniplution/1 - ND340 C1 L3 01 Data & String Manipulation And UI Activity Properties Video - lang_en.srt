00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,365
Welcome back and awesome work on completing the first two lesson,

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:06,465
and starting with the third lesson.

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,490
The world is full of data,

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,260
so is the RPA world.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,610
We need to alter the data as per the process need,

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,255
to make it more meaningful and readable to both human and the robot.

7
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:24,855
In this lesson, we will learn about string manipulation,

8
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:30,825
collection, its type, and how to perform manipulation on collection.

9
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:34,620
We will look at some common UI properties,

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,340
and we will also look at the overview of.NET Framework and VB.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,450
At the end of this lesson,

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,145
you will be able to;

13
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:48,235
describe data manipulation and its importance,

14
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:52,245
apply data manipulation methods suitable for RPA to

15
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:57,300
different types of data structures and variables, explain collection,

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,865
its type and manipulation,

17
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:03,300
understand and correctly use the properties of

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,480
UI interface activity to make them robust, reusable, and scalable.
