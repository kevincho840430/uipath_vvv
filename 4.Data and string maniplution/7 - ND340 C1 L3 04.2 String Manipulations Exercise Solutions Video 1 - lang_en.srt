1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,610
Now that we have learned the common string manipulation methods,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,060
let us use it in the exercise.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:16,335
Here, we will build a workflow that converts an integer to string.

4
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:21,660
To do so, you'll ask a set of inputs from the user.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,270
You will ask the name of the user,

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,945
and you will also ask the age of the user.

7
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,765
Depending upon the age provided,

8
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:35,460
we need to calculate the year birth of the user.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,265
Let us see the solution for it.

10
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:40,879
Here inside the sequence,

11
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,685
we're using Input Dialog activity.

12
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:45,605
In this Input Dialog activity,

13
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:47,710
we are asking the name.

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,455
The input is stored in a variable, username.

15
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:53,585
In the second Input Dialog box,

16
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:56,935
we are asking it from the user.

17
00:00:56,935 --> 00:01:03,400
The input will be stored into a variable called last userAge.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,835
As you can see in the Variable panels,

19
00:01:05,835 --> 00:01:08,925
we have userName of the type string,

20
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:12,615
and we have userAge of the type integer.

21
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:16,255
The next activity is the Assign activity.

22
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:21,590
In this activity, we will calculate the user year of birth.

23
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:29,020
To do so, we will do a simple calculation that is the present year minus the userAge.

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,560
To find out what is the present year,

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,115
we will use the Now.Year property.

26
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:39,045
For Now.Year will give you the current year.

27
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:42,725
So it's Now.Year minus the user age,

28
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:46,750
and we will assign it to a variable yearOfBirth.

29
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,005
As you can see, in the Variable panel,

30
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:51,680
the yearOfBirth is an integer variable.

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,140
Now, we need to convert this integer variable into strings.

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,120
In the Message Box panel,

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,870
we have the custom message and the message is, "Hello, username.

34
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,080
You were born in the yearOfBirth".

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,435
We'll use a ToString method to convert it into a string.

36
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:15,760
Let us run the bot.

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,715
Here you can see it is asking for a username.

38
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:22,700
There you go, the age,

39
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,315
we'll say the age is 28.

40
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:27,795
Perfect, you got the output.

41
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:31,395
"Hello Heba. You were born in 1992".

42
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:37,010
The year in which the video was recorded is 2020.

43
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,930
Hence, we got the date of birth as 1992.
