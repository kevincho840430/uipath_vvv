1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,395
Let us try to retrieve some information from the string using Analytics Builder.

2
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:10,800
To do that, under the activities panel,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,550
we will use the activity name, matches.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,050
Drag and drop the activity into the designer panel.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,245
Click on the Configure Regular Expression button.

6
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:25,725
This window, is the regex builder.

7
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:31,290
Before proceeding further, let us copy some test data into it,

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,085
so that we can test our regex over here.

9
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:40,080
This extra information, it contains some numbers.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,865
It contains an e-mail address,

11
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:44,055
it contains website URL,

12
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:46,445
it contains the date of birth,

13
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:49,595
and it also contains some address.

14
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:52,025
Let us go ahead and look at

15
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:57,305
all the options that are available under the regex drop-down call box.

16
00:00:57,305 --> 00:00:59,855
The first one is the literal.

17
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:03,949
As you can see, the default value is given as abc,

18
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:07,565
and since there is no text present,

19
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:11,705
abc, so there was no string retrieval happen.

20
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:17,770
Let us go ahead and change it to a data that we have in the text.

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,520
As you can see, the value has been changed to niyaz,

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,655
and all the values from the string or the text has been retrieved.

23
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,125
Let us look at the other options, digit.

24
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:38,350
Here you can see all the numbers from the string has been retrieved.

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,570
We can look at the options such as e-mail.

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,745
Here, you can easily see

27
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:49,945
the e-mail addresses has been successfully retrieved from the string.

28
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:53,750
We can click on URL and you can see the URL

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,160
has been retrieved from the entire string text.

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,610
The date, from the entire text available,

31
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,549
the date was easily retrieved.

32
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,755
Let's click on phone number.

33
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:09,845
Here you can see the phone number has been

34
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:13,940
successfully retrieved from the entire piece of information.

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,540
Apart from that, you can also add your own custom regex that you need.

36
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,315
In our case, we need to find the office address.

37
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:29,805
To do that, we will click on the Advanced option,

38
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:31,875
and inside the value,

39
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,560
we will pass the regex.

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,405
Now you could see easily the addresses has been retrieved successfully.

41
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:42,510
If you look at the regex,

42
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,620
we are looking for numbers ranging from 1-8 and characters ranging from a-z.

43
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,460
Apart from that, we are looking for some of the keywords such as;

44
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,190
road, avenue, circle, and so on.

45
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,770
With the help of this regex,

46
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:05,645
we are able to get a variable to retrieve the address successfully.

47
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:09,610
Let us go ahead and build a program.

48
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:16,630
In this sequence, we will retrieve all the numbers from the string,

49
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,055
and we will display it into the output panel.

50
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:26,160
To do that, we will take an Input Dialog activity,

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,579
drag and drop the Input Dialog activity,

52
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,550
let me give a title to this dialog box.

53
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,995
Here we'll enter the label for the Input Dialogue box.

54
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:44,349
We will store the text entered by the user into a variable.

55
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,830
Hit "Control K" to create a variable,

56
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,425
and let me give a variable name.

57
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:52,680
The variable name is a regexText.

58
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,120
That means the information that the user is

59
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,325
entering will be stored into a variable called as regexText.

60
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:03,885
Now, I'll use the matches activity.

61
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:05,820
I'll click on the "Configure",

62
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,825
since I want to only use digits,

63
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:11,045
I'll click on the "Digits",

64
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:13,150
and I'll click on "Save".

65
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,065
In the properties panel,

66
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:19,175
I'll pass the input variable.

67
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,150
Our variable is regexText.

68
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,805
On our regexText variable,

69
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:31,790
the digit pattern will be applied and we will get a new set of result.

70
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,375
Let us store it into a new variable,

71
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:41,615
hit "Control K" to create a new variable and let us go ahead and create a new variable.

72
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,585
New variable created is digit.

73
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:48,770
Since it is going to have more than one value,

74
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,620
we'll have to use a loop.

75
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,860
We'll use a For Each loop over here to iterate through all the values.

76
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,870
Drag and drop the For Each loop.

77
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:07,020
Pass the regex outcome over here, that is digits.

78
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,960
For every iteration we will print the item.

79
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,165
I'm using the right line activity here for printing the values in the console,

80
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:20,580
and I'll be using items.

81
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,415
Let us execute this program.

82
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:27,075
Here there is the Input Dialog box,

83
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:30,215
which is asking a text from the user.

84
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:33,805
We'll use the same text that we saw earlier.

85
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:38,930
Click "Okay". The program has been successfully completed.

86
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,015
Let us open the output panel,

87
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:44,615
and here you can see all the digits from the text

88
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:49,440
has been retrieved successfully and we have printed it.
