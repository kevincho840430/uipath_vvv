1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,185
Let's first understand the difference between the type

2
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:08,520
of recorders to understand better each recording mode,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,370
and the environment they operate.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,015
The basic recorder: a basic recorder is used to automate the desktop application.

5
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:22,920
It is used when we only want to work with a single window.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,440
Desktop recorder: a desktop recorder records the desktop application,

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,655
when multiple actions are performed in numerous windows.

8
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:39,835
While recording, it fixes all operations inside the attach a window container.

9
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:44,225
Web recorder: it is used to automate activities

10
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:48,740
performed on website using one of the three major browsers,

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,739
that is IE, Chrome, and Firefox.

12
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:58,340
It is used when we want to act on any web-based applications and website.

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,060
All the actions that we perform come under the attached browser activity.

14
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,980
Image recorder: it uses images for all virtualized environment.

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,395
The automation cannot identify all the application.

16
00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:17,195
It relies on image recognition.

17
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:22,405
First the position of the element used in automation is needed.

18
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:26,915
Citrix recorder: native Citrix is used for

19
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:32,255
Citrix environment that were configured to support new iPad native Citrix.

20
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:38,180
The configuration involves installing several apps and plugins on the client

21
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,805
and server machine and using studio 2018.4 or later.

22
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,255
Once the setup is made,

23
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:53,135
native Citrix generates selectors and works like the desktop recorder.

24
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:59,635
Let us understand the difference between a basic recorder and the desktop recorder.

25
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:06,590
Basic recorder is used with multiple windows when it causes the interference problem.

26
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,350
It generates default selector.

27
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,190
For example, if you have to write something in Notepad,

28
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,930
you open an untitled Notepad and perform your actions inside it.

29
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,190
The basic recorder does not use the container.

30
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,790
Your iPad uses the name of the currently open file name of

31
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,280
the application title of the window to identify the correct window on the screen.

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,180
In some cases, multiple windows are identical.

33
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,620
Suppose it opens two untitled windows at the same time

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,330
then your iPad will perform all actions inside the first open window.

35
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,350
Because in this case,

36
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,725
the title of both Notepad application is same, that is untitled.

37
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:56,490
The next is the desktop recorder.

38
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,505
It is used when multiple actions are performed in many windows.

39
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:06,575
It nests all activities inside the attach a window container.

40
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:10,970
It uses container to ensure that other activities

41
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,545
of the same application don't interfere with your workflow.

42
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:21,455
The top-level window selectors are inside the attach window and it

43
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:27,475
generates the partial selectors for activities inside the attachment window container.

44
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:33,800
Automatic recording is used for recording multiple actions in one time.

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,595
There are four activities that are automatically generated using automatic recording.

46
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,175
They are, click, type into,

47
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:47,740
select items, and check.
