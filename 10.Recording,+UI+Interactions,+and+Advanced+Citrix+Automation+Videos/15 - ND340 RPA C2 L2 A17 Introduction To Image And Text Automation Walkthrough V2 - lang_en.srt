1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
In this example, we will see how to use the image recording.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,235
Image-based automation relies on the user interface element recognition.

3
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:16,545
It is helpful in the situations where UI automation fails to work.

4
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:22,065
This basically happens when the selector cannot be found using the regular method.

5
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:26,340
In our example, we will use the Citrix environment.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,990
In this Citrix environment,

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,330
we will automate this application.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,700
[inaudible] will open up this application,

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,925
and we will fill some values into the application.

10
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:43,735
To begin, we'll pick on the Recording and we'll choose the image recording from here.

11
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:51,935
Now, we'll use the Click Image and we will mark a boundary across this application.

12
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:55,220
We can set the mouse position to center,

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,720
top-left, top-right, or the bottom left, or the bottom right.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,550
Or else, you can also specify a point where you want to click,

15
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,745
that is the center of the icon.

16
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:14,270
Awesome. Now, let us try to input some values into this text field.

17
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,239
We'll make use of the text activity,

18
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,960
and we'll enter the first value.

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,889
We'll make use of the text-based automation,

20
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:26,060
or the keyboard shortcuts available,

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,020
and we'll try to enter the rest of the values from here.

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:36,770
To do that, we will use the tab hotkey and we'll enter the next value here.

23
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,125
We again use the tab value,

24
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:43,535
and we will enter the next value from here.

25
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:46,480
Awesome, let us click "Enter."

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:52,475
As you can see, all the three values were entered using the keyboard shortcuts,

27
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:55,640
let us save and exit.

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,335
Here you can see all the activities have been made available here,

29
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:04,205
such as the Click and the Type Into activity.

30
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:08,280
Let us go ahead and run this automation.

31
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,380
As you can see, the bot has started and it

32
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,800
has entered the values into this corresponding field.
