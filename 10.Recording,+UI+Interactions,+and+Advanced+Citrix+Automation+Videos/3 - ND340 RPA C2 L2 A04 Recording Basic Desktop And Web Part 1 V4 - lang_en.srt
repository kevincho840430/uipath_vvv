1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
Recording is an important tool in UiPath Studio.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,300
It captures our limits every activity step by step.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,940
The UiPath recorder works in the same way as Macros Recording app.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,690
It automatically generates the sequence of

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,070
all the activities which we need in the workflow for automation.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,894
Apart from this, it also allows you to modify

7
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:32,430
the property of activities and change it in the workflow sequence.

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,680
How does it work?

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,290
Let's start with an example which you are already acquainted with.

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,380
That is the Excel Macros.

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,865
In Visual Basics Application or the VBA code,

12
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:48,109
we use Macros to record steps.

13
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:51,545
These steps can be things like typing,

14
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:55,715
clicking on cell or command on a ribbon bar or a menu bar,

15
00:00:55,715 --> 00:01:01,265
formatting cell in a spreadsheet or importing data from an external source,

16
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:03,605
such as Microsoft Access.

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,445
This way, the user saves time on

18
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:13,655
predictable and repetitive tasks without having to write a single line of code.

19
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:18,890
The recorder in the UiPath is a particular activity capable of

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,405
working with different types of apps or different types of environment,

21
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:26,960
identify the element on the screen,

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,340
reading data from the screen, and so on.

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:38,225
The list of actions that the UiPath recorder can automate is as follows, left-click,

24
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:42,710
check boxes, drop-down list that is showing them,

25
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,865
and also choosing the element and typing the text.

26
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:52,595
Apart from this, the recorder does not automatically record some activities,

27
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:56,255
such as keyboard shortcuts like Control C,

28
00:01:56,255 --> 00:01:58,715
Control V, modifier keys,

29
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:02,805
that is the Shift and the Control mouse,

30
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:05,535
right-click and mouse hover.

31
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:09,170
UiPath has many types of recorders,

32
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,115
and here are a few that you will commonly encounter.

33
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:15,800
That is, Basic, Desktop,

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,480
Web, Image and the Native Citrix.

35
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,975
The three that we will cover here are the Basic recording,

36
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:27,415
the Desktop recording, and the Web recording.

37
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:33,875
The concept of Image and Native Citrix will be covered later in this lesson.

38
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:38,150
The recording wizard for all the three types of recorders

39
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,515
consists of three types of component, Save & Exit.

40
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:49,115
This option is enabled only when the recorder is on.

41
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:54,425
It closes the recorder and reverts to the designer window,

42
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:58,130
display the automatically generated activities.

43
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,545
The next is Record.

44
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:08,275
It starts automatic recording mode in which multiple input activities are generated.

45
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:12,965
The user will see a blue screen over the area where

46
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:17,765
an action is captured and yellow outlines for selectors.

47
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:21,115
The last is a Manual Recording Actions.

48
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:24,255
Here, the options are Starting Apps,

49
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:27,285
Clicking, Type into, and so on,

50
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:30,380
actions that the user can select to

51
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,159
generate single activities during the recording process.
