1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,355
In this data scraping example,

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:08,085
we will scrape the title of the book and the date from the Amazon.com website.

3
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:12,660
To begin that, we have already used the open browser activity.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,505
Within the open browser activity,

5
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:17,520
we have mentioned the amazon.com URL.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,650
After that, we are using a type into

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,100
activity and then we are searching for the automation books.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,070
Now, we will start our data scraping tool.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,260
To do that from the ribbon bar,

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,165
click on data scraping.

11
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:32,205
A new window comes up.

12
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:36,435
Let us try to understand what does is window asking?

13
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:38,730
The window has three steps in it.

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,650
The first step is asking you to open up your browser or

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,490
the application or the document from where you want to scrape the data.

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,655
In our case, the Amazon page is already opened up.

17
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:51,835
The next step it says,

18
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:55,550
press next in this dialogue box and then hover over

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,780
the data that you want to extract and then click that field.

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,915
We'll click the Next button and we will hold upon the data that we want to extract.

21
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:10,055
In our case, we want to extract the book title.

22
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:13,445
We'll click here. A new window comes up,

23
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:17,375
but just asking us to select the second element.

24
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:21,020
This is because we want to create a pattern.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,760
Click on Next and click on the Next Book Title.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,365
Here, you can give a name to the column as you are

27
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:36,155
extracting more than one information that is more than one book title,

28
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:39,205
you will be storing it in the form of what column.

29
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:42,450
Now here, we need to give a column name.

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,150
Let us give the column name as book title.

31
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,240
Awesome. We have an additional option here,

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,210
which is extract the URL.

33
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,490
Now, this works upon the data which has a URL embedded behind it.

34
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,015
In our case, when we click on any of the book title,

35
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:04,795
it takes us to a new web page.

36
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:08,390
Basically there is a URL embedded behind it.

37
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:13,040
The data scraping tool can also extract the URL from it.

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,385
We will click on this and we will name this column as URL.

39
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:22,640
Click Next. Here you can see we have

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,100
extracted all the book title and the URL from the first page.

41
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,320
Let us verify the last data.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,620
The last data is the condensed Handbook of Measurement and Control,

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,445
and we have the last book there.

44
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:42,550
Now let us try to understand what are the fields in this window?

45
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,005
The first field that we are interested is the maximum result field.

46
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:48,645
Over here, by default,

47
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:50,385
it is set as 100.

48
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:55,130
That means the data scraping tool will scrape 100 data.

49
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,830
If you want to scrape all the data,

50
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,920
you have to mention zero.

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,740
Else if you want to explicitly mentioned any custom number,

52
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,285
you can give the number here.

53
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,975
In our case, we will extract 50 records.

54
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:12,725
The next button is the extract co-related button.

55
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:19,075
Now this button is responsible to extract more data from the same page.

56
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:22,220
In our case, we want to extract even the date.

57
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,380
To do that, we'll click on extract correlated data,

58
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,170
and we will point towards the date.

59
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,985
I click on that.

60
00:03:30,985 --> 00:03:34,830
Now, we also have to make a pattern for the date.

61
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,165
Click on Next and point out to other date.

62
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:45,940
Awesome. Now you can see all the dates have been taken by the data scraping tool.

63
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,430
Give a name to this column,

64
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,630
we'll give the name as date.

65
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,950
As you can see the extract you had an option is still available,

66
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,960
but in our case there is no URL behind the date and neither there interested in it.

67
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,480
We will make it as uncheck and we will proceed further.

68
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,155
Awesome. Here you can see we have now the book title and the URL,

69
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:12,320
and we have the next column that is date.

70
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,200
If in case you want to scrape more data,

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,465
you can click on extract correlated data and scrape more data accordingly.

72
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,980
Now, we'll click on Finish.

73
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,105
Here there is another window which pops up,

74
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:31,880
and it is asking, is your data spanning in multiple pages?

75
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,845
That means is your data here spanning in multiple pages?

76
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:40,565
If yes, then click on yes and point

77
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:44,360
to the button from where you can navigate to the next screen.

78
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,405
In our case, the button is here.

79
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:51,695
Awesome. Here you can see we have

80
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:57,400
the data scraping tool and inside the data scraping we have the extract data.

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Here we will just add a delay between multiple pages.

82
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,845
We'll add a two second of delay.

83
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:10,430
By default, all the data that has been scraped will be stored in a data table.

84
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,070
The data table name by default is kept as extract data table.

85
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,245
If you want you can change the variable name.

86
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:21,590
Now, the next thing that we need to do is we need

87
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,790
to store this data table into an Excel sheet.

88
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,735
We will use a right range activity,

89
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:33,000
drag-and-drop derived range activity.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,215
Within this right range activity,

91
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:40,485
we will pass the workbook URL.

92
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:43,150
In our case, we will create the workbook.

93
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:49,945
We will name the workbook as automation books with the extension.

94
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:55,355
Over here, you need to specify the data table that you want to write.

95
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,440
In our case, the data table name is extract data table.

96
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,480
Awesome. Make sure you click on the add

97
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,155
headers so that your column names is also included.

98
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:09,240
Let us run the automation.

99
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,340
As you can see Amazon page is opened up,

100
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:20,765
automation book was search and now the multiple spanning of the pages will begin.

101
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:24,695
Now, the automation has completed successfully.

102
00:06:24,695 --> 00:06:27,425
Let us verify the Excel file.

103
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:33,380
Let us open this excel file and here you can see we have the book title,

104
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,110
we have URL and the date.

105
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:42,360
We have 51 record because the first entry is the column name.
