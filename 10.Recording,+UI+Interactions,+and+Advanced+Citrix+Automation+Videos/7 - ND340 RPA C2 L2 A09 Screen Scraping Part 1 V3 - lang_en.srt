00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Screen scraping is the process of extracting

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,050
data from a specified UI element or a document,

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,150
such as a PDF file.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,475
Screen scraping methods are the core of all the activities

5
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:20,475
that enables data from a specified UI element or document.

6
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:24,600
In some cases, data is sent directly to

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,030
the user or from one activity to another by using variables or arguments.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,710
But in other cases,

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,120
other methods are needed to take data from various screens or document.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,750
This is the screen scraping methods are used.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,880
They enable data extraction from UI element that the automation workflows interacts with.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,750
Screen scraping wizard enables the user to point

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,100
at a UI element and extract text from it.

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,940
The steps are, starting the screen scraping wizard from the design ribbon in the UiPart.

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,270
The screen goes into a computer vision mode,

16
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,710
highlighting the UI element that it defines with blue.

17
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,965
Once the user selects the UI element,

18
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:17,615
studio automatically chooses a screen scraping method.

19
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:20,990
After it finishes extracting the text,

20
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,570
the wizard shows the outcome.

21
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:30,185
The user can select one of the three methods and customize it using the properties.

22
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:35,720
Clicking the refresh button displays the outcome according to the new settings.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,155
FullText output method.

24
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:43,805
The FullText output method is the default output method in UiPart.

25
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:45,350
It is the fast,

26
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,650
accurate, and can work in the background.

27
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,505
It captures all the texts from the terminal screen,

28
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:54,360
including the hidden text.

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,485
For example, the options in the drop down list.

30
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:01,535
It does not work on Citrix and different virtual environment.

31
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:05,765
It does not retain formatting and text position as well.

32
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:10,480
The method offers the following options, ignored hidden.

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,529
When ignored hidden method is selected,

34
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:20,975
it offers the option to ignore the hidden messages and capture only the visible text.

35
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,375
The native output method.

36
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:27,050
It can be used only with the applications that are

37
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,695
built to render with a graphic device interface.

38
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:34,775
It is useful when the coordinates of each word,

39
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:39,685
font, and color of the text are required to be written accurately.

40
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:43,005
However, it has its limitations as well.

41
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,605
It only extracts the visible text,

42
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:50,270
cannot work in the background and does not support Citrix.

43
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,590
The method offered the following options.

44
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:00,215
No formatting, when the font and color are not necessary to be captured,

45
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:04,040
this box can be checked and the wizard extracts or leave

46
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,615
the text just like the FullText method, get words info.

47
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:15,680
This option can extract the position of each word and can support several separators.

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,715
By default, it can process all known characters as separators like comma, or space.

49
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:26,225
But when specific separators are specified,

50
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,520
it ignores the other.

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,290
Additionally, the custom separator field is displayed enabling

52
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,180
the user to determine the character used as a separator.

53
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,610
If the field is empty,

54
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,400
all known text separators are used.
