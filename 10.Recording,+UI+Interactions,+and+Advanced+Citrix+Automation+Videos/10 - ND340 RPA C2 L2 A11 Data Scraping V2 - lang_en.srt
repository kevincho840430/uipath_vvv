Data Scraping is the process of extracting structured data from a browser,

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,230
application or document to a database,

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,574
that is a CSV file or an Excel spreadsheet.

4
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:18,210
It is used to create a data table at runtime.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,170
It can extract all the pattern-based data

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,380
and store it into the form of a data table automatically.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:33,440
Data Scraping always generates a container that is attach browser or attach window,

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,085
with a selector for the top level window and an extracted structured data activity.

9
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:47,285
This activity will extract data from the indicated webpage using a partial selector,

10
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:52,120
ensuring the correct identification of the app being scraped.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,370
All the script information is stored in

12
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:01,084
a data table variable that can later be used to populate a database,

13
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:05,790
that is a CSV file or an Excel spreadsheet.
