00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,070
Welcome to the second lesson of this course.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:08,220
Here, we will mainly focus on how to extract information from the screen.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,870
In this lesson, we will learn recordings in the UI part

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,390
and we will also see what are the different types of recording in the UI part.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,330
Next, we will look at these scraping techniques.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,710
Here, we will learn about the screen scraping mechanism and

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,510
the data scraping mechanism and also look at the advanced scraping mechanism.

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,175
We will look at the image and text automation in the UI part and we will look

9
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:39,920
at the Citrix automation and what are

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,165
the challenges that we face in the Citrix automation?

11
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:45,605
At the end of this lesson,

12
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:50,630
you will be able to differentiate between actions that can be

13
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,784
recorded automatically and actions that have to be manually recorded in UiPath,

14
00:00:56,784 --> 00:01:01,220
use the basic desktop and web recording

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,570
and know the situations in which each of them is appropriate,

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,460
use the screen scraping wizard and configured

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,029
input and output methods as appropriate to the context,

18
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:21,070
use the data scraping functionalities of UiPath in the appropriate context,

19
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,240
learn how to perform basic image and text automation,

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,720
as well as virtual machine applications automation.
