00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,865
Firstly, we will learn about recording.

2
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:05,520
That is, we learn about the basic recording,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,735
the next stop recording,

4
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:09,345
and the web recording in UiPath.

5
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:12,840
Next, we will learn about the types of UI interaction.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,550
Here, we will speak about the input and the output action.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,505
Next, we will learn about the scraping techniques in UiPath.

8
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:24,485
Here we will learn about the screen scraping,

00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:26,555
we will learn about data scraping,

10
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:30,610
and we'll also see what are the advanced scraping techniques.

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:36,020
Next, we will learn about how can we use an image and a text automation.

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,310
Lastly, we will learn how to automate a Citrix environment,
