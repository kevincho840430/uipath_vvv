1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,010
OCR output method, although both full text and

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,200
native have excellent result in terms of accuracy and speed,

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,655
there are specific cases in which both are unstable.

4
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:18,255
For example, if we need to extract information from

5
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:23,250
a virtual environment or read text from the images,

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,215
the optical character recognition output method should be used,

7
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:34,650
it is based on the OCR technology used in the recognition of scanned documents,

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,740
it attempts to recognize each letter or given an image in the target document.

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,770
It is slow compared to the other method, has lower accuracy,

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,035
it varies from one text to another,

11
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:50,510
it cannot extract hidden text,

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,485
and it cannot work in the background.

13
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:57,465
The OCR methods has two default engines,

14
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:00,975
Google Tesseract and Microsoft MODI.

15
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:06,995
The use of this engine depends on the type of information being extracted.

16
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:12,155
In general, it is better to switch between the methods to see which

17
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:17,345
of the engine brings better results for each particular situation.

18
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:24,615
If the user has downloaded and installed the package of other OCR engines such as AMI,

19
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:29,435
they will also be available by choosing the OCR engine.

20
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:34,220
Google Tesseract OCR, this method gets better results for

21
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:40,625
character recognition on the smaller size area and it supports color inversion,

22
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:44,990
it offers multiple customization through filters that

23
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,925
can be used to select only a specific categories of character.

24
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:54,325
This method offers the following options: Language,

25
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:58,255
this is English by default, Character,

26
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:03,980
enables the user to select which type of character to be extracted.

27
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,115
The following options are: any character, numbers only, letters,

28
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:12,015
uppercase, lowercase, phone number,

29
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:14,790
currency, date, and custom.

30
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,520
When custom is selected,

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,080
two additional fields, allowed and denied,

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,660
are displayed that enables the user to create custom rules

33
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,850
of which types of characters to scrape and which to avoid.

34
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,260
The next is Invert,

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,829
when this check box is selected,

36
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:38,240
the color of the UI element are inverted before scraping,

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,545
this is helpful when the background is darker than the text color.

38
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:46,904
The next is Scale,

39
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:51,570
the scaling factor of the selected UI element or image,

40
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,265
the higher the number,

41
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:55,275
the larger the image,

42
00:02:55,275 --> 00:03:02,240
this can provide a better OCR read and it is recommended for small images.

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:09,325
Get Words Info, it gets the on-screen position of each scraped word.

44
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:18,570
Microsoft OCR, this method is used to work with Microsoft fonts and on larger size area,

45
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,395
it supports multiple languages.

46
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:25,935
This method offers the following options: Language,

47
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:30,290
enables the user to change the language of the script text,

48
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,215
by default, English is selected.

49
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:38,995
Scale, the scaling factor of the selected UI element or image,

50
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,815
the higher the numbers,

51
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:42,285
the larger the image,

52
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:47,345
this can provide a better OCR read and is recommended for small images.

53
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:53,970
Get Words Info, it gets the on-screen position of each scraped word.
