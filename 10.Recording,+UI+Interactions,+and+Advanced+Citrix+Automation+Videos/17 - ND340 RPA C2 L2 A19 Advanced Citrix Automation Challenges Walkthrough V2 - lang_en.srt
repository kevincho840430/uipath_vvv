1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,790
In this example, we will see how to use the Native Citrix Recording.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,910
But before starting, let us try to understand more about the Native Citrix recording.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,200
The Native Citrix recording option allows you to identify

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,580
the UI element in the Citrix app and automated them.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,395
Whereas on the other hand,

6
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:26,925
the image recording that we have already used still exists

7
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:31,965
to perform the traditional image and the text-based automation.

8
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:36,000
By installing the UI path extension for Citrix on the

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,159
client machine and the UI path remote runtime component

10
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,505
on the virtual application server,

11
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:50,525
you can now create automation projects for Citrix app as if they were local applications.

12
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:55,355
Selectors are natively generated for Citrix app element,

13
00:00:55,355 --> 00:01:00,050
and you can use the full range of UI automation activities,

14
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,405
such as click, typing to get text,

15
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:06,300
extract data and many more.

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,315
In that case, over here,

17
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:10,565
we have a Citrix environment.

18
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:12,140
In this Citrix environment,

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,815
we will try to type the information into the notepad and we'll try to save it.

20
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:21,515
To begin that from the recording,

21
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,469
we will use the Native Citrix.

22
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:29,604
Over here, we'll start typing into the Notepad.

23
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:34,875
As you can see, the selector is been readily available.

24
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:39,515
We'll type the message as Citrix recording.

25
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:42,505
Awesome. Hit enter.

26
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:46,320
Now we'll click on the file.

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,125
There is no need for anchoring it.

28
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:53,110
Now, we will click on Save As.

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:02,040
Awesome. Now, we will use a type into activity to give a name to the file.

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,370
We'll save the file with the name Citrix.

31
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,440
Lastly, we'll click on the Save button.

32
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,900
Now, we will close this application.

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,985
Let us save and exit the recording.

34
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:31,340
Here you can see the activities available for them.

35
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,500
Let us run the application.

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,440
Before that, we'll open up the notepad application here.

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,810
Now, let us run the automation.

38
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,920
Perfect. We were able to run the automation successfully.
