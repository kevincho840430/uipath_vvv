1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
In this exercise, we will use the Data Scraping UiPath

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,445
and we will scrape the blocks from the white part page.

3
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:12,375
To do so, let us use the data scraping tool.

4
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:17,490
Here, we will scrape the block from this particular page,

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,015
and here, we will scrape only the RPA blocks.

6
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:25,215
Click Next and indicate the RPA block.

7
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:27,375
Let us create a pattern.

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,645
Let us scrape one more RPA block.

9
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:33,705
Awesome. Let us give a column a name.

10
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:39,105
We'll name it as RPA block and click on Next.

11
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:43,350
Here, you can see the RPA blocks that have been scraped.

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,235
Here, we are only interested in 15 blocks,

13
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:49,890
and we'll click on Finish.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,800
Now, here, it is asking,

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,470
is the data spanning in multiple pages?

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,435
Over here, the Load More button will act as spanning in multiple pages.

17
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:04,405
We'll click Yes, and we'll indicate on this button, Load More.

18
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:12,470
Awesome. Now, we'll drag and drop the right range activity after the data scraping.

19
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:18,050
Over here, we will save the data into an Excel sheet with the name block.

20
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,630
As you can see, there is no block created.

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,240
Now, let us run this automation.

22
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,760
Over here, you can see the UiPath block page has been

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,300
opened up and the data has been successfully scraped.

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,385
Let us do a refresh, and over here,

25
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:38,020
you can see the Excel file has been created.

26
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,300
Here are the 15 blocks that we have scraped.
