1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
In this example, we will learn how to use the recordings in UiPath.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,790
First, we will start with basic recording and then move to desktop recording and lastly,

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,420
we will see how to use the web recording.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,080
For the basic recording from the ribbon bar,

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,525
click on ''Recording'' and click on the ''Basic recording.''

6
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:28,910
This is the Window which comes up for the basic recording.

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,935
Here we will use the Notepad application for building the automation.

8
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:38,020
We will type into the Notepad and we'll save the Notepad.

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,460
To begin with, first,

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,645
we need to open up the Notepad.

11
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:44,450
For that, we'll click on the ''Start Apps''

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,765
and we'll select the ''Start app activity from here.''

13
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:52,515
Will point to the notepad and it is asking us,

14
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:55,150
"Is this the application that you need to open up?"

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,390
We will say confirm,

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,430
we need to open this notepad.

17
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,685
You can skip the argument for now.

18
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:06,545
Now we will use the automatic recording and we will continue further.

19
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:08,685
Next is, we need to type.

20
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:10,965
We will point to the text area over here

21
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:14,480
and we will type the message in this balloon box.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,560
The message that we will type is UiPath.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,710
Here we have two options.

24
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,230
Type password for typing password and empty field.

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,665
The empty field options allows you to erase

26
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:31,385
the pre-existing text and then write the new text.

27
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:35,155
Once the text is written, press ''Enter.''

28
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:40,415
Here you can see the bot has performed the type into activity.

29
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:42,720
Next, we'll click on ''File.''

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,920
Hold your mouse to the file and then perform a click.

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,690
Now it's asking you,

32
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,580
"Do you want to use an anchor?"

33
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,355
We have learned about anchors in these selectors chapters.

34
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:59,930
In our case, there is no need to anchorate because the file location or

35
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:06,500
the file is always going to be in the same place for each and every notepad application.

36
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,860
We will ignore this.

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,990
We will say, ''No, we do not want to anchorate.''

38
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,780
Next, we will click on ''Save as.''

39
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,990
Perfect. In this new Window,

40
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,010
we have to give a file name.

41
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,785
We will hover the mouse over the file name text box and we will click here.

42
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:27,590
Now this activities are so smart that they

43
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,485
can differentiate between the click and the type.

44
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:33,170
Now this is a type activity hence,

45
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,385
we got the balloon to type your name.

46
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:39,125
Here we will type the file name.

47
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:45,695
We'll type the file name as UiPath and we'll make sure that we check the empty field.

48
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:48,235
Press ''Enter.''

49
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:51,480
Next is we need to save the Notepad.

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,040
To do that, we'll hover over the save button and we'll perform a click.

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,855
To stop the recording,

52
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:04,940
you have to press the Escape key from your keyboard.

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,920
Here you can see in the desktop the file has been created.

54
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,990
Next, we can click on ''Save and exit'' to get out of the recording.

55
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:23,720
Here you can see all the set of activities that we have performed is available.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,150
Starting from opening of the notepad,

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,819
typing into the notepad,

58
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,915
performing the file, and then save as,

59
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:34,240
then lastly clicking on ''Save.''

60
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,920
Let us run this bot.

61
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,640
The bot was able to perform the desired task.

62
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,390
Now, let us move ahead and see the next recording.

63
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,475
That is the desktop recording.

64
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:01,810
For desktop recording also we will do

65
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,190
the same exercise that is automating the notepad application.

66
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,750
On the ribbon bar,

67
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,975
click on ''Recording'' and click on ''Desktop.''

68
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:15,220
This is the Window that comes up for the desktop recording.

69
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,070
To start with, we will say start up and

70
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,175
will indicate the notepad application. Click on ''Okay.''

71
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:27,855
Here we will again use the automatic recording option.

72
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:35,105
We will point out to the text area where we want to print or type our data and

73
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:42,240
we will type the text as the Udacity and hit ''Enter.''

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,865
Next we'll click on ''File.''

75
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:47,130
There is no need for anchoring it.

76
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,725
We'll click on ''Save as'' and here we will give a name.

77
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:57,900
We'll say with the name Udacity, hit ''Enter.''

78
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:04,370
Next, click on the ''Save button'' and escape the recording.

79
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,745
Here you can see the Udacity file has been created.

80
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:09,830
Click on ''Save and exit.''

81
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:15,110
Here is all the activities that we have used in the recording.

82
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,950
Now, the bot will perform the same task as in it will open up the notepad,

83
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,760
type Udacity and save the application.

84
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,330
But now let us see the difference between

85
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:33,005
the basic recording and the desktop recording as we have learned earlier in the lessons,

86
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:36,320
that the basic recording gives us

87
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,255
a full selector and a desktop recording gives us a partial selector.

88
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:46,985
Basically, what we want to do is the basic recording does not use a container,

89
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:51,140
whereas a desktop recording always uses a container.

90
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,645
Here you can see all the activities are grouped into one sequence.

91
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:59,825
We can look at the selector for the same.

92
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:02,660
Over here, when you look at the selector,

93
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,425
each and every selector includes the parent node.

94
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:10,020
Here, we can also see the same thing.

95
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,560
Let us look at the desktop recording.

96
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,205
Here in the desktop recording,

97
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:20,690
you can easily see that you have a container for the different set of activities.

98
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,165
This is one container.

99
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,145
Here is the second container,

100
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:27,695
and here is the third container.

101
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:31,535
This helps us to generate a partial selector.

102
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:36,019
Here, you can look at the selector for the type into activity.

103
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:37,745
As you can see here,

104
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,680
this part has been grayed out.

105
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,600
That means it comes from the parent activity,

106
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,920
as in it comes from the open notepad application.

107
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:54,320
All the activities inside this container will follow the parent node.

108
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:00,445
Let us look at the third type of recording that is the web recording.

109
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:05,790
Here we'll navigate to the IMDb movie rating website.

110
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,360
We will search for a movie and we will display the movie rating to the user.

111
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,680
To begin so click on the ''Recording'' and click on the ''Web recording.''

112
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,155
Here is the Window that comes up for the web recording.

113
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:24,530
Over here, the first thing that we need to do is,

114
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,690
we need to open up the browser.

115
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,310
Click on the ''Open browser'' and say open browser.

116
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,805
Point anywhere on your webpage.

117
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:37,250
Here is the URL and we'll confirm,

118
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,475
yes, we need to open up this web page.

119
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:44,720
Next, we can start with the automatic recording.

120
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,110
Click on the ''Recorder'' and over here we will input the movie name.

121
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:55,785
I'll input the movie name as Joker and hit ''Enter.''

122
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:59,585
Next is, we need to click on this particular movie,

123
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:02,010
that is the Joker movie.

124
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,265
Awesome. The next thing that we need to do is,

125
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:10,325
we need to get the ratings from here.

126
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:17,045
To do that, we will escape from the automatic recording and from the manual recording,

127
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:20,015
we will select the ''Copy text.''

128
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:24,005
We will point out to the rating area over here.

129
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:29,495
Awesome. Let us save and exit the recording.

130
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:33,500
As you can see, all the activities have been displayed here,

131
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,870
right from opening up the browser,

132
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,685
typing the movie name,

133
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,155
clicking on the movie,

134
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:45,230
and here we have a Get Text activity which fetches the rating from the webpage.

135
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,100
By default, there is a variable created called a span.

136
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,670
You can verify it in the variable panel.

137
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,000
We will change the variable and we will name

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,440
the variable as Rating to make it much more meaningful.

139
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,575
Now, we need to use a Message Box activity and inside the Message Box activity,

140
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:09,500
we will display the rating to the user.

141
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:19,505
Drag and drop the Message Box activity after the Get Text and give the input as rating.

142
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:24,390
Perfect. Now let us run this automation.

143
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,475
Now you can see the web page has been opened up.

144
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:31,745
The movie name was searched and the movie was clicked.

145
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:38,580
Now, here the Get Text activity is working and here we are displaying the movie rating.
