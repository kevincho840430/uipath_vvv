00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,305
Relative scraping is one of the advanced scraping techniques.

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:06,690
It is based on OCR engine,

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,280
but it uses it for recognizing the character and

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,545
choosing another UI element as an anchor for the forced UI element.

5
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:20,115
This results in the following order of activities.

6
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:25,380
First, the process will attempt to identify the anchor, and second,

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,755
it will search for the UI element to scrape data from

8
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:32,760
using the relative positions on the screen.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,790
This is particularly useful while selectors are unavailable for various reason.

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,245
UI elements are not recognized directly or

11
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:49,175
the activities apply to all virtual environments, such as Citrix.

12
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,845
The attribute of a UI element,

13
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:58,930
such as exact screen position or its ancestor can be extracted.

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:05,704
Data scraping is about getting texts from UI element using various methods.

15
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:10,990
In certain circumstances, this is not the easiest thing to do.

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,235
UI path offers several activities that may come in handy,

17
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:18,735
such as Get Ancestor.

18
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:21,770
As you may recall from the selector lesson,

19
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,760
UI elements are in parent-child structures.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,530
This is always visible from the structure of selectors.

21
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,850
First general classes, then particular classes,

22
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,215
then sub-classes, and so on.

23
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:40,715
When you open up a notepad file,

24
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:44,240
the selector will go up to the notepad app,

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,445
then to the category of app that Notepad is a part of, and so on.

26
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:56,660
Get Ancestor retrieves the ancestor or the parent of a UI element.

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,660
Get Attributes.

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,285
UI element have plenty of attributes.

29
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:04,610
Think of a button on a website.

30
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,620
It has a color or name or state, and so on.

31
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:16,385
Get Attribute is the activity that enables the identification of a certain attributes.

32
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:20,315
The user can specify the attributes and

33
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:25,145
the activity retrieves the value of that specific attribute.

34
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,780
Get Position.

35
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,795
This activity retrieves the actual position on the screen of a specific element.

36
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:38,435
It can be very useful when there are many similar elements on the screen.

37
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:40,910
Without knowing the actual position,

38
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,300
it would become very difficult to identify them.
