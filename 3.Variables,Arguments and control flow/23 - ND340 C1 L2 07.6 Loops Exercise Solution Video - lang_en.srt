1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
Now that we have learned about loops in UiPath,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,960
let us try to implement it in this exercise.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,785
Here you have to build a workflow for guessing a number.

4
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:13,860
First, we need to generate a random number in

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,210
the studio and then prompt the user to input a number.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,580
In case of a round input,

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,280
we have to display a message saying,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,385
please entered a lesser or a greater number.

9
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:29,220
The loop should keep on running till

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,795
the input number is equal to the generated number in the studio.

11
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:36,405
Let us look at the solution.

12
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:39,715
Here we are starting it with a sequence.

13
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:44,485
Inside the sequence, we are using a do-while loop.

14
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:46,565
In the do-while loop,

15
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:50,960
we are first taking an input dialog activity.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,090
In the input dialog activity,

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,690
we are asking the user to guess a number.

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,555
Before that, in the Variables panel,

19
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:06,140
we have generated a random variable and we have assigned the value as 25.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,985
Now, depending on the number that the user has given,

21
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:13,250
we will do a condition check.

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:21,125
If the number entered by the user is equal to the number that we have generated,

23
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,155
then we'll put a message box saying,

24
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:25,970
you guessed it correct.

25
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,380
As we are going to do a different condition check,

26
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,830
here we will check if the number entered by

27
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,445
the user is greater than the number that we generated.

28
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:40,625
If so, they will print a message saying,

29
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,100
please enter a smaller number.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,985
Or else they will pass a message to the user,

31
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:50,000
saying, please enter a grater number.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,575
This loop will keep on running till the time

33
00:01:54,575 --> 00:02:00,335
the number entered from the user and the number generated is not equal.

34
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:06,395
The moment both the number becomes equal or the condition evaluates to true,

35
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:11,030
we will break the loop and the program will exterminate.

36
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,470
Let us run this example.

37
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,760
Let us enter a number.

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,359
The generated number is 25,

39
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:22,500
let us enter 20 as the input.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,085
As you can see, we've got a message box saying,

41
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:28,465
please try a greater number.

42
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:32,530
Let us give 30 as the input.

43
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,865
Here we got a message saying,

44
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:36,560
please try a smaller number.

45
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,800
Let us give the number as 25.

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,430
Perfect, we got the correct answer.
