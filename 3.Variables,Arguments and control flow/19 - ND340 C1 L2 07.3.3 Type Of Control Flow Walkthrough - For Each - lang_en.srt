1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Let us look at the forEach example now.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,545
In this example, we have created an array of the string type.

3
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:12,930
You can select the type from here.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,810
You can choose array of T,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,860
and you can give the value of T as string over here.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,645
This array that consists of four names,

7
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:27,615
and the variable is employee name.

8
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:31,620
We will use forEach activity.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,110
In this forEach activity,

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,200
we are passing the array name here.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,370
Now, each and every element from

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,530
the array will be taken and it will be stored inside this item.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,925
Inside the forEach, we are printing the item.

14
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:55,660
That means for the first iteration out of

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,580
the entire array Heba will be picked up and it will be printed.

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,405
On the second iteration,

17
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:05,545
Christa will be picked up and it will be printed.

18
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:09,850
It will go till the last element that is Heather in our case,

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,295
and it will print the last element.

20
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:15,020
Let us run this example.

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,395
As you can see, we got the first name, the second,

22
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:24,670
third, fourth, and then now the automation should stop.

23
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,090
Perfect.
