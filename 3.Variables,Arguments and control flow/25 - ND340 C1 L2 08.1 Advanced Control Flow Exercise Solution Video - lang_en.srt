00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,550
Now that we have learned how to use the advanced control flow in UiPath,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,330
let us use that concept in this exercise.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,740
Let us first try to understand what is the use case.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,835
In this workflow, you have to calculate the sum

5
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:22,020
of five positive numbers entered by the user,

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,810
but we have two conditions for that.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,265
The condition one is,

8
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:29,355
if the user enters a negative number,

9
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:31,410
we need to skip the calculation.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,040
That means we are not going to add the negative numbers entered by the user.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,790
The second condition is,

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,330
if the user enters zero as the number,

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,405
we need to break the loop, as in,

14
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:50,200
we need to break the addiction then and there itself and display the sum directly.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,950
Let us see the code for it.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,510
To begin, we have chosen a sequence for it,

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,265
and inside the sequence,

18
00:00:58,265 --> 00:01:02,270
we have used an assign activity where we

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,560
are initializing a variable called as sum with zero.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,965
This sum is the variable that we will keep on adding our result into it.

21
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:16,875
We have used a for reach loop to iterate for the five times.

22
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,500
Inside the for reach loop,

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,035
we're using an input dialog activity,

24
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:25,385
and we are asking the user to enter the number for the addition.

25
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:31,760
The number entered from the user is stored into a variable called num.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:38,615
Now, we will do a condition check on the number entered by the user.

27
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:41,520
If the number is less than zero,

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,750
that means if the number is a negative number,

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,484
we'll directly call the continue activity,

30
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:53,710
as in, we will not do any addition and we will skip to the next iteration.

31
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,235
But if the number is greater than zero,

32
00:01:57,235 --> 00:02:00,425
then we have a different set of condition check over here.

33
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:03,680
Here we will first check if the number is zero.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,375
If the number is zero,

35
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,075
we will break the loop.

36
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:09,770
But if the number is not zero, that is,

37
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,080
if the number is a positive number,

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,570
then they will do the addition of that number.

39
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,415
We'll do the addition, that is,

40
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:20,120
sum plus the number entered by the user.

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,300
This loop will iterate for five times depending upon the number entered by the user.

42
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,285
After that, we are using a message box to display the addition to the user.

43
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,480
Let us run this exercise.

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,065
Let us enter all the five positive integers for default span.

45
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:43,590
Enter the first number,

46
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,805
so we'll enter one.

47
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:48,620
Is asking to enter the second number,

48
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,365
we'll enter two, seven, four and five.

49
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:58,650
Now we got the addition as 19.

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,610
Now, let us try to insert a negative number and zero,

51
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,260
will enter a positive number for the first time.

52
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,915
Now, we will enter minus eight as the number.

53
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:15,830
Now, since we are entering a negative number,

54
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,730
we are not supposed to do a calculation of it.

55
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,185
If we hit Enter right now,

56
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:24,260
our value should be only positive two.

57
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,805
We will hit zero as the third number and we'll click "Okay".

58
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:32,555
Now, if you are entering zero,

59
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:35,405
that means we should break the loop, as in,

60
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:38,345
we should stop doing the addition and display whatever

61
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:41,610
is the sum of the number and there you go.

62
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,405
The addition is two because,

63
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:46,120
on the first iteration we entered two,

64
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,690
on the second iteration we entered a negative number and we are not doing an addition,

65
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,025
and on the third iteration,

66
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:56,310
we entered zero, and that is the reason the answers is two.
