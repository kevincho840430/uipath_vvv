1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
Control flow is the order in which activities or

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,490
actions are executed or performed in a workflow.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,260
Control flow, if enacted through control flow activities which are

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,795
used to define the decision to be made during the execution of a workflow.

5
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:22,590
The execution of control flow activities help

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,795
the user to choose a suitable path to follow in the workflow.

7
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:30,360
These activities are found in

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,830
the activities panel under the workflows activities section.

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,980
The flow of an automation projects can be controlled in two ways.

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,865
The first one is the decision based control.

11
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:49,910
Here, a decision is made on the basis of a specified condition.

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,310
If the condition is met,

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,690
the program executes one part and if not,

14
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,165
then it executes some other part.

15
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:03,415
This consist of the if and default activity.

16
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:07,365
The second type is the iteration based control flow.

17
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:12,140
Here, a particular part of a program is executed many

18
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,495
times until a specific condition is met or it holds through.

19
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:21,260
This consists of loops such as while,

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,695
do while, and for each.

21
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:26,265
In addition to these two types,

22
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:32,750
there are other types in your iPod that helps the user to control the flow of execution.

23
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,400
This includes activities like dealey, parallel, assign, etc.

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,820
These activities are discussed in details in the coming section.
