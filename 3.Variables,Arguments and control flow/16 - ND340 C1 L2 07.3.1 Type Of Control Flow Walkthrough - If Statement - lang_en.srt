00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,815
In this section, we will see how to use the types of control flow in the UiPath Studio.

2
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:14,580
To start with, we will use the if control flow statement.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,460
Here, in this example,

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,645
we are trying to find whether the number

5
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:26,715
entered from the user is an even number or an odd number.

6
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:33,030
To do so, we have taken a foster activity as the input dialog activity.

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,815
Here, the user will enter a number.

8
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:45,784
The corresponding number will be stored in a variable called as numbers.

9
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:48,830
As you can see, there is a variable created here,

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,715
a number of the type integer.

11
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:56,390
After the user has entered the number,

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,935
the control goes to the if activity.

13
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,375
In the if activity under the condition,

14
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:07,040
we are implying the conditions for

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,555
finding out whether the number is an even or an odd number.

16
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:16,865
Depending upon the outcome of the condition that is true or false,

17
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:21,260
the following then, or else block will be executed.

18
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,030
If the number mod 2 is equal to 0,

19
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,725
then this message box is printed,

20
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:31,295
which says the entered number is an even number.

21
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:34,670
If this condition evaluates to false,

22
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,640
then the control goes to the else block and then this message box is displayed,

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,360
which says the entered number is an odd number.

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,305
Let us run this example.

25
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:49,655
Here there is the input dialog box,

26
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:52,070
which is asking ''enter the number.''

27
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,355
Let us enter an even number.

28
00:01:55,355 --> 00:02:02,090
As you can see, we got a message box and it says the entered number is an even number.

29
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,315
Let us try to run it one more time,

30
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:10,625
and this time we will give an odd number. There we go.

31
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:17,000
You've got the correct message box which says the entered number is an odd number.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,980
Let us look at the switch example.

33
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,765
Here, in the program we are printing the days of the week,

34
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:30,900
depending upon the number inputted from the user.

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,630
To start with, we have used an input dialog activity,

36
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,040
which is asking the user to enter a number.

37
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,195
The entered number is stored in a variable called as number.

38
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:48,665
The control then flows to the switch activity.

39
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:51,830
In the switch activity under the expression,

40
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,490
we have passed the numbers.

41
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:02,630
Depending upon the value that the number is holding we have made seven cases accordingly.

42
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,050
Case one prints it's ''Monday,'' case

43
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,970
two ''Tuesday,'' case three ''Wednesday,'' and the last case seven,

44
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,680
prints it's ''Sunday. ''

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,920
If the user enters a number which is not in the range of one to seven,

46
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,580
we have a default block which brings the message,

47
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,645
''enter the number within the range.''

48
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:28,260
Let us run this example.

49
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,970
Here there's an input box which is asking for the number.

50
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,685
Let us give the number as two.

51
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:39,875
We're expecting the output should be Tuesday, perfect.

52
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:45,530
Let us run this example again and will give number eight.

53
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,280
In this case, we should get the message box,

54
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,060
which is displayed in this default Block.

55
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,530
Perfect. For it says ''enter the number within the range one to seven.''
