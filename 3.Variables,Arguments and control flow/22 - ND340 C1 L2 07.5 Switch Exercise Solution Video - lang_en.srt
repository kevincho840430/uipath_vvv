00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,995
Now that we have learned how to use a switch activity in UiPath,

2
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:08,295
let us try to implement it in this exercise.

3
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:14,715
Here, you have to build a workflow which ask the user about their eye color.

4
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,995
Depending upon the eye color,

5
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:20,645
you have to give a personality message to the user.

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:25,215
First, you have to ask the user his eye color.

7
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:28,425
If the user enters blue,

8
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:30,885
you have to give a message saying,

9
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:32,865
"You must be very brave."

10
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,310
If the eye color is green,

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,020
the message should be,

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,045
"You must be generous."

13
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:41,730
If the eye color is gray,

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,575
the message should be,

15
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:45,765
"You must be very wise."

16
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:48,690
If the eye color is black,

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,415
the message should be,

18
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:52,545
"You must be very bold."

19
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:55,310
Let us see the solution for it.

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,234
Here, we started using a sequence.

21
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:00,650
Inside the sequence, we are using

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,735
an input dialog box which is asking for the color of the eye.

23
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:12,095
The user input is stored in a variable called eye color.

24
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:15,560
Next we are using a switch activity.

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,469
In the switch activity under the expression,

26
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,815
we are passing the user input.

27
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:24,875
If the input from the user is blue,

28
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:28,145
we will pass the message, "You are brave."

29
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:32,470
If it is green, we will pass the message, "You are generous."

30
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,915
If it is gray,

31
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:35,250
we will pass the message,

32
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,705
"You are very wise."

33
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:39,360
If it is black, you will pass the message,

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,740
"You are very bold."

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,275
Now, if the user enters any other column,

36
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:50,405
the control will go to the default block and here we will say,

37
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:52,715
"Can't recognize that color."

38
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:55,525
Let us run this example.

39
00:01:55,525 --> 00:02:00,300
First, we will enter black and you got the answer,

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,740
"You must be very bold."

41
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,380
Let us execute it and give the input as green.

42
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,985
Here it says, "You must be generous."

43
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:16,650
Now, let us give a color, brown.

44
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,675
As you can see, the control goes to the default block which prints the message,

45
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,940
"Can't recognize that color."

46
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,720
The reason, we have only made cases for color blue,

47
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,270
green, gray and black.
