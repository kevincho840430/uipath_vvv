00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,645
Namespace are containers which hold groups of unique names.

2
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:11,085
Let's understand namespace through an example.

3
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:19,530
College A should not have two students with the same ID and neither College B should.

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:26,670
But there is no problem for the same ID number to be used in both these schools.

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,675
If Heba is a student in College A and Daniel is a student in College B,

6
00:00:32,675 --> 00:00:38,495
then it is not a problem for each of them to have the ID 123.

7
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:46,460
In this example, the ID number is the identifier and the college serves as the namespace.

8
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,775
It does not cause problem for the same identifier

9
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:53,724
to identify a different student in each namespace.

10
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:58,040
VB.NET namespace in UIpath Studio represents

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,075
the container that store different types of data.

12
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:09,035
They enable you to easily define the scope of your expression, variables, and arguments.

13
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,350
Some namespace are automatically imported when you

14
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,710
browse for a dot-net type variable or argument.

15
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,090
For example, if you have System.Data namespace imported,

16
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,670
you can further use data table,

17
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,650
data view, data column,

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,120
data row, and other classes that are available in it without

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,340
having to always type the system.datatable and so on.

20
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,410
All imported namespace are displayed in the import panel.

21
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,529
Note that some namespace are automatically

22
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:46,864
imported when you browse for a dot-net type variable argument.

23
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:51,870
To open this, click Imports in the designer panel.
