1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
In order to manage the variables in your iPad,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,965
the user needs to perform several actions on them.

3
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:10,890
These actions can be categorized as,

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,605
creating variables, initializing variables, and removing variables.

5
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:18,960
Let us look at all of them.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,780
To do so, click on the Project panel and open the Main.xaml file,

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,610
in the design of panel.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,185
Click on the Activities panel,

9
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:33,500
and search for an activity named Sequence.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,555
Drag-and-drop the Sequence in the Designer panel.

11
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:42,440
Let us look at the first way for creating variables.

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,125
Click on the Variable panel,

13
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,400
and click on Create a Variable.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,900
Give a name to your variable.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,445
Here, the variable name as first name.

16
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:58,280
You can choose the variable type as String,

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,400
and here we will initialize the variable.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,460
We'll give a default value to our first name variable.

19
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,755
We will use our Message Box activity,

20
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:13,535
and within the Message Box activity,

21
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:16,535
we will print the variable.

22
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:21,410
Let us look at the second way for creating variables.

23
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,990
You can create a variable,

24
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,735
from the Designer panel itself.

25
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:31,150
To do that, we will use an Assign Activity.

26
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,780
Drag and drop the Assign Activity after the Message Box activity.

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,820
In the Assign activity,

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,730
you can see we have two properties.

29
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,780
The To and the Value.

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:55,490
Click on the To section and use the shortcut ''Control K'' for creating a new variable.

31
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,695
You can also right-click and say, Create Variable.

32
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:03,200
Create a variable over here.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,240
We have created a variable with the name employee ID.

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,880
Let us change the variable type to Int digital.

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,520
Over here, you can provide the value to the variable.

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,895
Let us use a Message Box and print the value of the variable.

37
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:29,340
Let us look at the third way for creating a variable.

38
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,010
You can create a variable from the Properties panel.

39
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,200
To do so, we'll use the Assign Activity again.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,260
Click on the Assign Activity,

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,360
and click on the Properties panel.

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,570
Here you can see the properties of the Assign Activity.

43
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,570
We have the To property,

44
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,655
and we have the Value property.

45
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:53,250
We'll click on the To property,

46
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,710
and we'll use the shortcut ''Control K'' for creating a variable.

47
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,590
Hit ''Enter'' for creating a variable.

48
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,435
Here you can see a variable with company name has been created.

49
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:10,775
We'll change the variable type to String.

50
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:15,200
We can give the value in the Properties panel itself.

51
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,090
We'll give the company name as Udacity.

52
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:25,955
We'll use an another Message Box to print the value of the company name variable.

53
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,125
Let us run the process.

54
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,475
Here you can see the first Message Box,

55
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:34,650
which is the name.

56
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,435
The second Message Box,

57
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,355
which is the employee ID,

58
00:03:38,355 --> 00:03:43,165
and the third Message Box which is the company name.

59
00:03:43,165 --> 00:03:48,740
Let us now look how can we remove variables.

60
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:58,015
To do so, you can click on the Variable and press the ''Delete'' key from your keyboard.

61
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:05,275
Also, you can click on the Variable name, and say delete.

62
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:10,420
Here, we have learned how to create variables.

63
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,380
So variables can be created either using the Variable panel,

64
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,060
the Designer panel, or the Properties panel.

65
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,595
We can delete the variables by hitting the ''Delete'' key,

66
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:30,870
or by doing the right-click and then selecting ''Delete'.
