1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
Now that you have learned about

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:06,315
the fundamental structure for creating a process in the Studio,

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:11,925
you can now start building the actual automation of a process.

4
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:16,365
In this lesson, we learned about variables, arguments,

5
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:22,665
and namespace, and also saw the difference between a variable and an argument.

6
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:30,390
We also learned about decision-based and iteration-based control flow in UiPath.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,070
In the next lesson,

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,120
we will learn about data manipulation and UI activity properties in UiPath.
