1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
Now that we have learned how to use the if activity in Uipath,

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,670
let us implement it in this exercise.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,550
In this exercise, you have to build a workflow which asks the user,

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,135
do you want to get the second marshmallow or not?

5
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:21,090
For that you have to ask the user,

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,340
"Do you want to eat the first marshmallow now or after five minutes?"

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,815
If the user answer is now,

8
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:32,445
we need to respond to him saying, "Oops!

9
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,115
You will not get the second marshmallow."

10
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:41,040
Else if the answer is after five minutes you have to response saying,

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,299
"Congratulations, you will also get your second marshmallow."

12
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:52,205
If the user enters the option other than now or after five minutes,

13
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:55,910
you have to respond to him saying, "Invalid option."

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,130
Let us see the code for it.

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,025
We have begun choosing a sequence.

16
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:06,665
Inside the sequence, we have used an input dialog activity.

17
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:10,345
In the input dialog activity we will ask the user,

18
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:13,320
when does he want to eat the marshmallow?

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,050
As in now or after five minutes?

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:21,775
The user answers will be stored into variable coalesce user input.

21
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:24,110
Depending upon the user input,

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,560
we will do a condition check using the if activity.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,965
If the user option is now,

24
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,340
we will directly print a message saying, "Oops!

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,385
You will not get the second marshmallow."

26
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:38,120
Or in the else part,

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,535
we will do one more condition check.

28
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:45,380
Here we will check if the user input is after five minutes.

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,360
If this condition is true,

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,055
we will print the message.

31
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,685
"Congrats! You will get the second marshmallow."

32
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:59,855
Or else, if the user has given an input which is neither now or after five minutes,

33
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:04,285
here we will print a message saying, "Invalid input."

34
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:07,425
Let us run this workflow.

35
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:10,950
Let us give the option as now.

36
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,920
Perfect. So we have got the message saying, "Oops!

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,005
You will not get this second marshmallow."

38
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:20,230
Let us give the input as after five minutes.

39
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,900
Let's hit Okay.

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,970
You've got the message saying, "Congrats!

41
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,845
You will get the second marshmallow."

42
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:31,920
Now, let us try to give an input apart from this two options.

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,965
Let us give the option user input as never.

44
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:44,820
Lets hit "Okay" and you got the message saying this is an invalid input.
