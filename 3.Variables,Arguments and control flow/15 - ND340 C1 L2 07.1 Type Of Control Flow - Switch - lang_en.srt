1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,185
Deficient based control helps the user to decide

2
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:09,195
the execution flow of a program based on certain conditions.

3
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:13,470
These conditions are specified by a set of

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,975
conditional statement having the Boolean value true or false.

5
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:22,125
Each of this condition when met,

6
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:26,085
transpose the control to execute a block.

7
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:33,720
A block is a package step of instructions that performs a specific task.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,865
This package can be used in program to perform that specific task.

9
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:44,325
Whenever the specified condition is met,

10
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:47,730
one of these blocks is executed.

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,595
There are two types of division activities in the new iPod.

12
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:57,520
They are the If Activity and the Switch Activity.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,495
The If Statement contains a statement with a condition

14
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:07,505
attached and two sets of instructions as an outcome.

15
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:10,340
They are Then and Else.

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,870
Then block Is used to execute a set of action when the condition is true.

17
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:23,210
Else block is used to execute a set of action when the condition is false.

18
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:30,430
If Activity is useful to make a decision based on the value of the variable.

19
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,705
For example, an automation to input a candidate name and

20
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:42,055
score obtained in an exam and decide if he has passed the exam or not.

21
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:46,175
Here, the condition is specified in the If Activity ,

22
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:49,145
which displays the result accordingly.

23
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:53,225
If the score is greater than or equal to 60,

24
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:55,700
then we have a message which says,

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,800
"Congratulations, you have passed."

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,335
If the condition is false,

27
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:02,335
then you get a message saying,

28
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:04,450
"Sorry, you have failed."

29
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:11,219
Switch Activity executes a set of statements out of multiple,

30
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,350
based on the value of a specific expression.

31
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,055
It is used in place of an If Activity,

32
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:24,095
when at least 3 potential courses of actions are needed.

33
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:30,530
It can be useful to categorize data according to a custom number of cases.

34
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:37,235
Here, the condition does not hold a Boolean value like in the case of If Statement,

35
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:40,595
but it holds multiple values.

36
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:45,815
By default, the Switch Activity uses the integer argument,

37
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:48,905
but it can be changed from the properties panel,

38
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:51,215
from the argument type list.

39
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:55,310
Switch Activity can be used to store data into

40
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,935
multiple spreadsheets or sort through names of employees.

41
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:03,720
For example, a week has seven days.

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,165
Each of the seven days can be associated with the number 1-7,

43
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:10,370
that is from Monday to Sunday.

44
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,750
To display the name of the day associated with a particular number,

45
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,030
seven cases are built using

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,800
this Switch activity and for any number who are not in the range of 1-7,

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,220
the default block will be executed.

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,000
If and Switch are both used for decision control.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,965
However, there are few differences between them.

50
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,000
In the If Activity,

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,380
the execution of a particular set of action,

52
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,995
that has the Then or else block,

53
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:48,260
depends upon the value of the condition that is true or false.

54
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,340
It uses multiple statements for multiple choice.

55
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,415
It evaluates in digital character,

56
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:58,840
pointer, floating type, or the Boolean type.

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,005
In Switch Activity, the execution of a particular satisfaction is decided by the user.

58
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:10,315
It uses single expression for multiple choices.

59
00:04:10,315 --> 00:04:14,795
Evaluates only character or an integer data type.

60
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:19,550
The use of Switch Activity is preferred over If Activity,

61
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:24,330
because it is easier to debug and read.
