1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
Now, let us look at a DoWhile example.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,240
In this example, we are printing a set of numbers

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,270
starting from one until a point where the user wants to print the number.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,010
To start with, we have used and input dialog activity.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:26,160
The input dialog activity is asking the last number of the range.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,830
The user enters the number,

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,750
and that number is stored in a variable called as last number.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,065
After that, the control flows goes to the do while activity.

9
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:42,455
In the do-while activity,

10
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:50,275
we are using a right line activity which prints the number in the output console.

11
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:55,715
We are using the assign activity to increase the number by one.

12
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:58,865
Here in the condition we have mentioned,

13
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:03,670
if the number is less than or equal to the last number,

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,755
that means for each and every iteration,

15
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:09,620
it will check if the current number is less

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,130
than or equal to the last number provided by the user.

17
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,355
If the number is still in the range,

18
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:18,680
it will keep on printing the number.

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,790
Once the number is equal to the last number or it becomes greater than the last number,

20
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,150
then the do-while blog will not

21
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,790
execute and the control will come out of the do while activity.

22
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,450
Let us run this example.

23
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,620
Here you can see there is an input dialog box which

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,835
is asking entered the last number of the range.

25
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:45,715
Let me put the number as 10.

26
00:01:45,715 --> 00:01:50,585
So we are assuming we will get the output which starts from 1 ,2,

27
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:53,375
3, 4 and it prints until 10.

28
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,480
Let's click on Okay.

29
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,250
Let us open the output panel and here you can see we have the numbers starting from 1,

30
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,490
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 until 10.

31
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,525
Let us look at the While example now.

32
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:17,130
In this example, we are trying to print the even numbers between 1-10.

33
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,820
To do so, we have used a while activity.

34
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,410
In the While activity,

35
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,480
we are specifying the condition.

36
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,530
If the number is less than or equal to 10,

37
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,995
the number variable has been initialized and

38
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:38,395
the default value is 1 because we need to start from 1.

39
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:42,230
Inside the while activity we have used an if

40
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,200
activity to check if the number is divisible by 2.

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,960
If yes, we will print the number or else we will do nothing.

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,130
After that we are incrementing the number by 1 so that we can check if that number,

43
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,575
again is an even number or not.

44
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:02,790
Let us run this example.

45
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,415
There we go, so we are getting 2,

46
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:11,560
4, 6, 8, and 10. Perfect.
