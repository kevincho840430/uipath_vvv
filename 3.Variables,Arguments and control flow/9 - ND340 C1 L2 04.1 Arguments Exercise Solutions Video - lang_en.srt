1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Now that we have learned about arguments in the Uipath,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,814
let us try to implement it in this exercise.

3
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:11,955
Here, you have to build a workflow which displays

4
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:16,920
the sum of two numbers taken as the input from the user.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,670
To do so, you have to create a workflow which accepts two number from the user.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,360
You have to create another workflow which does

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,065
the addition of these two numbers and prints the value.

8
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:37,630
Lastly, you have to invoke both of this workflow in the main.xaml file.

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,810
Let us see the solution for it.

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,690
Here we have a workflow with the name, accept numbers,

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,100
which accepts the number from the user, for the addition.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,630
Here, we are using two input dialog box.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,260
The first input dialog box is asking for

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,810
the first number and we're storing it into the argument out_num1.

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,110
In the second input dialog box,

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,495
we're asking the second number for the addition,

17
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:09,715
and we're storing it into the argument out_num2.

18
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:11,240
In the argument panel,

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,140
you can see the direction for both the argument is out.

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,095
Reason we will be giving out the values,

21
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:22,925
so that another workflow can take the value and do the addition.

22
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:26,105
The second workflow is the addition workflow.

23
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:31,525
Here we are doing the addition of both the numbers.

24
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:35,955
Here, we have created two arguments in_num1

25
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:41,270
and in_num2 because the direction is in foreboding argument.

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,630
Reason we will take the value from another workflow and then do the addition.

27
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:54,810
Lastly, in the main.xaml file via invoking both the workflows.

28
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,610
Here, in the input argument section,

29
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,830
we have created two variables,

30
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,840
num1 and num2 in the main.xaml file.

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,250
The value from out.num1 will be given out to num1.

32
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,795
The values from out.num2 will be given out and stood inside the num2 variable.

33
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:24,365
Now we will pass the num1 and the num2 variable for in the addition workflow.

34
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:26,330
Since the direction is in,

35
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,655
we will pass the num1 and num2.

36
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:34,620
Here, the value of num1 will be assigned to in_num1 and the value of

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,165
num2 will be assigned to in_num2 and the addition will be performed.

38
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:43,700
Let us run the code.

39
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,970
Here, it is asking us to enter the first number.

40
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,945
We will enter the first number as 25.

41
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:51,755
A second dialog box,

42
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,305
which is asking us to enter the second number.

43
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:56,705
Here, we will enter the number as five.

44
00:02:56,705 --> 00:03:03,010
Twenty-five plus five, we're assuming the answer should be 30, perfect.
