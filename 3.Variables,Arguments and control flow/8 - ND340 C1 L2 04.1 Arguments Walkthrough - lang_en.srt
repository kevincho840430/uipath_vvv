1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,070
Let us try to understand how to work with arguments.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,865
To do so, we will make lemonade.

3
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:10,965
Yes, you heard it right,

4
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:16,395
we will learn how to work with arguments while making the lemonade.

5
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:20,295
To do so, we have created two workflows;

6
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:24,285
the ingredient workflows and the recipe workflows.

7
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:27,675
The ingredient workflows is responsible to

8
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:31,710
collect all the ingredients needed for making the lemonade,

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,240
and the recipe workflows takes all the ingredients from

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,445
the ingredient workflow and then it states the step to prepare the lemonade.

11
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:48,815
To do so, we have created two input dialog box in the ingredient workflow.

12
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,700
The first dialogue box is asking the user to

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,920
enter the quantity of water needed to make a lemonade.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,240
The value has been stored into an argument out_water.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,325
The second dialogue box,

16
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:09,875
ask the user for the count of lemons needed to make the lemonade.

17
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:15,110
The user input is stored in an argument out_lemon.

18
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,165
As you can see, the direction of both the argument is out.

19
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:26,905
Reason, the arguments value from this workflow will be passed on to the recipe workflow.

20
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:28,640
In the recipe workflow,

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,025
we have created two arguments in_lemon and in_water.

22
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:38,435
The direction is in because it will get the value

23
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:43,685
from another workflow and then it will prepare the recipe for lemonade.

24
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:46,115
We can see the message box,

25
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:48,260
and the message box says,

26
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,700
extract the juice of the in_lemon,

27
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,050
that is the argument;

28
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,880
we convert it into a string,

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,140
mix it with the water,

30
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,680
that is in_water argument,

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,290
and add a tablespoon of sugar and mix it,

32
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,155
and your lemonade is ready.

33
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:07,950
This workflow needs two values,

34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,630
the in_lemon and the in_score water.

35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,265
Let us go ahead and open the main.xaml file.

36
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,635
In the main.xaml file,

37
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:21,685
we will invoke both the workflows.

38
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:25,625
First, we will invoke the ingredient workflow.

39
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:29,375
We will drag and drop the ingredient workflow here.

40
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,945
Once the ingredient workflow is completed,

41
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:36,065
we want the recipe workflow to be invoked.

42
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:42,815
We will drag and drop the recipe workflow underneath the ingredient workflow.

43
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:46,075
Click on the import argument.

44
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:53,905
Here, you can see the ingredient workflow is giving out an argument.

45
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:59,675
We need to store that argument into a variable in the main file.

46
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:02,270
Let us go ahead and do that.

47
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,330
Control K for creating a variable,

48
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,425
and we'll name the variable as Lemon.

49
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:11,820
We'll do the same thing for water,

50
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,690
I'll say Control K for creating the variable,

51
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,900
and I'll name the variable as Water.

52
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,685
You can see here,

53
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,935
in the variables panel,

54
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,660
there are two variables created, lemon and water.

55
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,370
What is going to happen now is,

56
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,835
from the ingredient workflow,

57
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,700
the lemon values will be stored in the lemon variable.

58
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,980
The water values will be stored in the variable water.

59
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,010
Now we need to pass these two variables into the recipe workflow.

60
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,335
To do that, click on the import arguments and over here,

61
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:52,525
pass the variable name.

62
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:57,535
For in_water, we will pass water as the input;

63
00:03:57,535 --> 00:04:03,560
and for in_lemon, we will pass lemon as the input.

64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,340
Let us run this process.

65
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,680
The first input dialog box is asking us to enter the quantity of water needed.

66
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,880
We'll say we need 500 ml of water.

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,895
Enter the count of lemons,

68
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:24,015
we'll say we need two count of lemons,

69
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:27,560
and now you can see the recipe workflows

70
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,610
is called and the argument have been passed correctly.

71
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,015
The messages extract the juice of two lemons, that we stated,

72
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,385
and mix it with 500 ml of water,

73
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:38,825
that is what we passed,

74
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,710
and add one tablespoon of sugar and mix it.

75
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,210
Your lemonade is ready.
