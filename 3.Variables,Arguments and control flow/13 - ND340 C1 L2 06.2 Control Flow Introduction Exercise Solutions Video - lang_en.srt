00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,874
Now that we have learned about the types of workflows in UiPath,

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:08,070
let us implement it in this exercise.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,895
Here we will use a flowchart and

4
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:16,980
a sequence and we will print a custom message using them.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,825
To begin so, we'll open the main.xaml file.

6
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:24,525
Under the activity panel,

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:28,095
we will search for a sequence activity.

8
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:32,805
Drag and drop the sequence activity in the Design panel.

9
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:38,105
In the sequence, we will use or write line activity for

10
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:42,585
the custom message making sure that

11
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:47,750
the custom message always has to be within the double quotes.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,705
Here the messages is,

13
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:53,130
"Professor is the mastermind of the heist."

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:00,025
Now, we will use a flowchart activity inside this sequence activity.

15
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:04,915
Under the Search bar in the Activities panel search for Flowchart.

16
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:07,880
Drag and drop the flowchart here.

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,444
Click on to open the Flowchart activity.

18
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:14,705
Inside this Flowchart activity,

19
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:18,050
we will use a Write Line activity.

20
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,270
In this Write Line activity,

21
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,665
we will print another custom message.

22
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:25,170
Here the message is,

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,405
"Berlin is the second-in-command of the Professor and he is his brother."

24
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:34,655
We will connect this activity to the Start Node.

25
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:38,470
Perfect. Let's get back to the main.xaml file.

26
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,340
Now here we have a sequence and in this sequence we are

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,935
printing a custom message using Write Line and after this we are using a flowchart.

28
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:53,080
Inside this Flowchart, we are again printing our custom message.

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,580
Let us execute this program.

30
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,280
The execution has completed successfully.

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,990
Let us open the Output panel and see our output.

32
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,545
Here you can see we got the message,

33
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:06,945
"Professor is the mastermind of the heist."

34
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:09,570
That is the sequence and,

35
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,215
"Berlin is the Professor's second-in-command and brother."

36
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:16,330
Which is coming from the Flowchart activity.
