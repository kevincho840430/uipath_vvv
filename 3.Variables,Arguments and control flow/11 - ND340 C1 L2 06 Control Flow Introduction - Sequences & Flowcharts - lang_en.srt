1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,655
In your iPad, control flow,

2
00:00:02,655 --> 00:00:07,770
is enacted using two separate concepts that influenced each other.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,020
The type of the project,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:16,335
that is workflow, and the control flow statements that can be used.

5
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:19,095
Let's take them one by one.

6
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:24,240
Here we will learn about the three types of workflows in new iPad.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,605
They are sequence, flowchart, and state machines.

8
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:31,575
In your iPad studio,

9
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:35,225
a sequence is a container in which multiple activities

10
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:39,470
are placed one after another and executed linearly.

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:46,310
Within the sequence, an activity is followed by the next activity in a linear fashion.

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,480
The sequence can contain any number of activities,

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,295
but no activity can be skipped during the execution.

14
00:00:55,295 --> 00:01:00,770
The program, when run must execute each activity linearly with

15
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,589
no possibility of skipping an activity or branching off to another activity.

16
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:12,665
A sequence can either solve as a standalone automation project or can be included

17
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:18,995
as a part of a workflow or a state machine to help grow the specific activities.

18
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:26,180
One of the key features of sequence is that it can be reused time and again.

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,200
In this section, we will learn about workflows

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,890
in your iPad and how are they different from sequences.

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,630
A flowchart is a type of project that consists

22
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,480
of various activities which can be connected to one another in multiple ways.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,135
It is diagrammatically approach,

24
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:54,320
which represents various steps involved in completing activities, task, and processes.

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,660
This helps the user to easily view and follow the process.

26
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,940
Flowchart can either be used as

27
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:07,670
a standalone automation project or included in procedures of large projects.

28
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,530
The most important aspect of flowchart is that unlike sequence,

29
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,180
they represent multiple branching logical operators that

30
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,780
helps to create complex business processes and connect activities in multiple ways.

31
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:31,130
They're two activities used to decide the flow of a program inside flowchart.

32
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,465
These are flow decision.

33
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:38,240
It is an activity which executes one of

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,525
two branches depending on whether a specified condition is met.

35
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:48,245
The branches are titled true or false by default,

36
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:52,765
but the names can be changed in the Properties panel.

37
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:56,600
This activity can only be used in flowchart,

38
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,020
and if equivalent to the If activity.

39
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,930
Important properties of these activities are condition,

40
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,600
true label and the false label.

41
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,915
The condition is used to analyze before one of the two branch is executed.

42
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:21,025
This field supports only Boolean expression, true Label,

43
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:28,070
enables the user to provide a description of the case in which the condition is met.

44
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,280
The description can be removed by

45
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,685
holding the mouse cursor over the flow decision activity.

46
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:40,025
By default, this is filled in with true or false label,

47
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:47,075
enables the user to provide a description of the case in which the condition is not met.

48
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:53,015
The description can be viewed by holding the mouse cursor or the flow decision activity,

49
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:56,750
by default, this is filled in with false.

50
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,685
Here you can see we have a flawed decision here,

51
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:06,710
and you can see the two labels here are true Label and the false label.

52
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,405
If the flow decision control evaluates to true,

53
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:14,150
it goes to the true label.

54
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,705
If the flow decision control evaluated to be false,

55
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,355
it follows defaults label,

56
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:23,035
and then it executes the corresponding activities.

57
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:25,935
The second one, the flow switch.

58
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:30,650
It is an activity that splits the control flow into

59
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,310
three or more branches out of which

60
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,710
a single one is executed based on a specific condition.

61
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:47,215
This activity can be used in a flowchart and as equivalent to the switching activity.

62
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:51,270
Here you can see we have flow switch,

63
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:59,550
it has multiple branches and each branch serves as a different case.

64
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:06,335
There is a default case available if none of the cases get much,

65
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:10,560
the sequences of the default is selected.
