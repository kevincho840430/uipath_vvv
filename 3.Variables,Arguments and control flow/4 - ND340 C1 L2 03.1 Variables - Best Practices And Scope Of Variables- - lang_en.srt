00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Let's see the best practices for naming a variable.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,875
You use clear and meaningful names.

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:12,900
The name of the variable should accurately describe its content.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,305
Assigned name in a consistent manner.

5
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:19,695
Adhere to using camel casing.

6
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:23,520
Keep variable names descriptive and short.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:32,040
For example, a variable named userName is acceptable versus the variable named uname.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,115
An another example where you can create

9
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:39,440
a variable name counter versus calling the variable as i,

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,110
j, and so on.

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:47,620
The type of variable defines the type of data that can be stored inside the variable.

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:53,555
The different types of variable available in your iPad are: String variables,

13
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:57,490
Boolean variable, number variable,

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,830
date and time variable, data table variable.

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,700
This is usually used to store a data which is in the form of rows and columns.

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,340
Generic value, QueueItem.

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,935
This is a UI path specific variable and Arrays,

18
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:20,410
these will be discussed in detail in the classroom.

19
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,190
Also, in addition to this,

20
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,070
there are two collection variables,

21
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,730
lists and dictionaries, which also will be discussed later.

22
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:38,615
Scope field determines the container in which the variable is available.

23
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:40,985
When the variable is created,

24
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:45,755
the user chooses the scope from the scope drop-down field,

25
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:50,975
where all the major sequences and sections of the programs are listed.

26
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:54,710
The scope of a variable should be defined correctly.

27
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,080
The variables should be defined only in the scope in which they are used.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,620
Making multiple variables unnecessarily available

29
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,370
for entire workflow can cause efficiency issues,

30
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,400
as well as the possibility for confusion.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,690
The user chooses one of these sequences and

32
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,670
the variable will then be available in the part of the walk-throughs.

33
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,890
The scope of the variable is limited to the selected container.

34
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,165
If a variable is declared for a parent activity,

35
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:33,440
then the variable is available in the entire workflow.

36
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,239
However, if the variable is declared in any specific activity,

37
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,790
then it is available only for the scope of that activity.

38
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:50,010
The scope of a variable cannot exceed the workflow in which it was defined.
