1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,575
Now let us understand the concept of scopes in variable.

2
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:07,830
Over here, we have taken a couple of sequences.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,400
We have the first sequence and we have named it as ScopeEx.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,700
Here we have an another sequence which we have named our sequence ones.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,010
Here be having another sequence which we have named as sequence two.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,005
Let us use an another sequence.

7
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:27,435
Drag and drop the sequence from the activity panel and place it below the sequence two.

8
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:29,925
Let us name it to sequence three.

9
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:36,105
Awesome. Now let us put a message box inside the sequence activity, and we're good to go.

10
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:38,250
Now in the variables panel,

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,790
we have declared for variables ID,

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,600
company, name and age.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,940
As you can see here in the scope,

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,105
all of them have been assigned the ScopeEx,

15
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:51,875
that is the parent scope.

16
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,925
Now let us try to change some of these scope of the variable.

17
00:00:55,925 --> 00:01:01,190
Let us click on sequence one and change the scope of the ID to sequence one.

18
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,935
Now, if you go ahead and use the message box of the scope X sequences,

19
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:12,775
and if you try to print the variable ID over here now you will get an error.

20
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:18,920
The validation error is saying that the ID is not declared or it is not accessible.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,200
Reason is because we have changed the scope of the ID variable to sequence one.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,325
The movement, we change it back to ScopeEx,

23
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:31,910
now you can see the error is gone and we have access to the ID variable.

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,825
Now the same can be done to all the variables that we have.

25
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:40,505
So in that case, we will give a variable to each and every sequence.

26
00:01:40,505 --> 00:01:45,350
Now, let's go ahead and change the scope of all the variables that we have over here.

27
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,945
Now, let us go ahead and click on sequence one

28
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:51,035
and changed the ID company to sequence one.

29
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:54,275
Let us go ahead and change the sequence two,

30
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:58,030
and let us put name under the sequence two.

31
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,010
For the sequence three,

32
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,030
let us put age as sequence three.

33
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,270
Awesome. Now, let us try to print some values over here.

34
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,545
As we know that the ID has been assigned the ScopeEx,

35
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:15,065
as it is we can access it over here.

36
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:18,260
Now you can easily see the rest three variables are

37
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,950
not available here because they don't belong to this particular scope.

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,040
Now, let us look at this sequence one scope.

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,960
Now, in the sequence one scope,

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,415
as you can see, we have access to two variables.

41
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:33,800
We have access to a company which is within the scope,

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,365
but we also have access to ID variable,

43
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,275
which comes from the parent scope that this ScopeEx.

44
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:42,200
Now the same goes with sequence two,

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,565
and the same also goes with sequence three.

46
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,600
Let us try to print all the variables from here.

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,730
Over here, we'll print age in the sequence two,

48
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,210
we will go ahead and print name,

49
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,005
and in the sequence one,

50
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:59,645
we'll go ahead and print company.

51
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:01,295
As you can see over here,

52
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:05,015
the ID is available to all the sequences.

53
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:07,325
That is it available in within all the scope

54
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:10,895
because the scope has been saved to the parents scope.

55
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:15,005
Let us run the workflow and see the output.

56
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:18,155
Now we got the corresponding output,

57
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:19,700
that is the ID,

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,390
the company, the name, and the age.
